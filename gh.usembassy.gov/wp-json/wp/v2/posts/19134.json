today,<\/p>\n<p>Members of the media,<\/p>\n<p>Honored guests,<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Akwaaba!<\/em> It\u2019s an honor to join you here this afternoon to formally welcome you home to Ghana from the United States.\u00a0 This year, 33 of you were selected among thousands of candidates who applied for this very competitive program.<\/p>\n<p>You are now part of the Mandela Washington Fellowship for Young African Leaders, the flagship program of the Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI).\u00a0 The extraordinary talents you have demonstrated will greatly contribute to this special fellowship.<\/p>\n<p>The program, as you know, is named after two leaders whose lives embodied the very foundational values and future of their respective nations.\u00a0 George Washington and Nelson Mandela saw the people as the foundation for conceiving their countries\u2019 democracies.\u00a0 They offer us still today a reminder on the awesome burden and a privilege of leadership.<\/p>\n<p>The examples set by Mandela and Ghana highlight the successes and promise of democracy.<\/p>\n<p>Nelson Mandela\u2019s life story also teaches us about the power of resilience.\u00a0 Everyone wants, needs, and deserves a better life.\u00a0 As the YALI program envisions, African challenges require African solutions, and those can mainly come from each of you as citizens and visionary young leaders.<\/p>\n<p>All nations face challenges and opportunities, including the United States.\u00a0 We should consider Madiba\u2019s spirit and his message that each person can make a positive and lasting difference.\u00a0 That all great journeys begin with a dream.<\/p>\n<p>Much has been said on the question of how to combat unemployment in Ghana.\u00a0 Yet America\u2019s constant message and belief is the importance of continuing to unleash the entrepreneurial spirit of all citizens.\u00a0 When Ghanaian young men and women in all ten regions conceive a business idea, they must be encouraged to follow their dreams in establishing it without red tapes and obstacles.\u00a0 Each entrepreneur has the potential to create jobs which are needed by a young population facing the challenges of unemployment after finishing high school or university.<\/p>\n<p>Citizens must celebrate the successes of others because when one wins, we all win.\u00a0 Governments cannot create enough jobs to employ a growing youth bulge.\u00a0 A dynamic, free, and growing private sector can offer those critical employment opportunities for young people to apply their talents and ambitions to build this nation and sustain their families and communities. \u00a0Jobs from Ghanaians for Ghanaians.<\/p>\n<p>The creative genius of people like Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Oprah Winfrey, and others can also be found right here in Ghana.\u00a0 Somewhere out there today may be a child who will invent new forms of communication, water irrigation and farming methods that will make Ghana a food exporter, perhaps even the first Ghanaian to lead your space program into the far corners of the universe, and with it greater knowledge for humankind.<\/p>\n<p>The United States of America and the Republic of Ghana are joined in both our challenges and opportunities.\u00a0 If Ghana succeeds, America and the world indeed succeed.<\/p>\n<p>With partners like you, we are committed to promote stronger trade and commercial ties between the United States and Africa by establishing a level playing field across African markets.\u00a0 We believe the youth in Ghana and the continent are a force for economic ingenuity and prosperity, and we reaffirm that the United States has an unwavering commitment to Ghana and to Africa.<\/p>\n<p>There are no limits to dreams, and we recognize great achievements don\u2019t just present themselves, they must be worked for with tremendous sacrifices.\u00a0 But the wind sustaining your dreams is your belief in yourselves and the unlimited potential of this nation.\u00a0 It is that spirit of optimism which contributed to your selection among many candidates to become a Mandela Washington Fellow.<\/p>\n<p>We hope that you enjoyed a great fellowship in the United States.\u00a0 Make sure to keep in contact with the people you met through this program.\u00a0 You never know where they will be ten or twenty years from now, and they don\u2019t know where you will be either!<\/p>\n<p>We are proud of you for taking on those and so many other causes centered on empowering youth, women, and girls to truly promote development through the power of their own ideas and efforts.\u00a0 America stands with you in pursuing those noble causes, and we believe in you.<strong><em>\u00a0\u00a0 <\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Finally, thanks for your service.\u00a0 The building of tomorrow begins today, and it begins with you. The hard work of promoting democracy and prosperity requires participants, not spectators.<\/p>\n<p>As was said when YALI was created, \u201cyou are the change you\u2019ve been waiting for.\u201d\u00a0 Thank you!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Counselor for Public Affairs Roberto Quiroz II\u2019s Remarks at Welcome Reception in Honor of the 2018 Ghana Cohort of Mandela Washington Fellows Marriott Hotel, Accra, October 11, 2018, 1:30-2:00 p.m. Distinguished 2018 Mandela Washington Fellows, Mandela Washington Fellows alumni present here today, Members of the media, Honored guests, &nbsp; Akwaaba!
