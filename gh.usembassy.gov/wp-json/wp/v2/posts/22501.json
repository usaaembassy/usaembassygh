The project targets women of reproductive age, newborns, youth and children under five.\u00a0 Messaging will encourage timely use of health services and products such as bed nets. The project will work nationally with additional focus on northern Ghana.<u><\/u><u><\/u><\/p>\n<p>Ghana has seen significant progress in health indicators over recent decades, but the COVID-19 pandemic has jeopardized some of the sector\u2019s gains. While behavior change takes time, it is the foundation of positive health outcomes.\u00a0 \u201cPromoting healthy behaviors and demand for health services is an essential tool in the fight to combat infectious diseases and improve the lives of millions. From the simple act of washing hands, to sleeping under an insecticide treated bed net, delivering a baby at a health facility, encouraging exclusive breastfeeding and utilizing modern family planning methods; all these actions require focused behavior change to make an impact on health outcomes\u201d Dr. Balsara added.<u><\/u><u><\/u><\/p>\n<p>The project will be implemented under the leadership and direction of the GHS\/HPD and northern regional health directorates.
