Jackson<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Warrivi Community, Mion District, Northern Region<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Wednesday, January 31st 2018 | 9:00 a.m.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I am honored to be here today in Warrivi to celebrate your great achievement \u2014 the completion of a Community-based Health Planning and Services Compound. On behalf of the U.S. government and USAID, I want to say Mbo nfaa or Congratulations to every community member here today.<\/p>\n<p>This day highlights the powerful collaboration between the U.S. government, the Ministry of Health, Ghana Health Service, District Health Assemblies, and the communities of Warrivi,\u00a0Tensung ,Nkwanta and Kunkon. The U.S. government, through USAID, has a long-standing relationship with the Ministry of Health and Ghana Health Service to improve health outcomes for all Ghanaians.<\/p>\n<p>We provide critical support across the areas of maternal and child health; nutrition; malaria; reproductive health; and HIV and AIDS. USAID\u2019s partnership with the Government of Ghana has already supported the construction of eight compounds in the Volta and Northern regions. Eighteen more will be completed and handed over by December 2018. The CHPS compound we are commissioning today is proof of our joint commitment.<\/p>\n<p>The CHPS approach brings health services closer to your households and allows you to make the most productive use of your time. You will no longer have to travel long distances to seek health care. Your children will have more time to go to school. Pregnant women in your communities<br \/>\nwill no longer have to take long, bumpy rides on a motorking to the district hospital. Investing in our women and children not only curbs preventable deaths, it is an economic investment. As Kofi Annan said, \u201cWhen women thrive, all of society benefits, and succeeding generations are<br \/>\ngiven a better start in life.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The success of CHPS is rooted in community ownership and self-reliance. President Akufo-Addo has also stated the importance of self-reliance in his Ghana Beyond Aid vision. This means investing our resources where we can make a lasting impact on the wellbeing of Ghanaians. The CHPS compounds do just that by making quality health services more accessible to communities that need them the most. Promoting solutions driven by local communities will enrich the quality of health systems and support Ghana\u2019s transition to a self- reliant nation.<\/p>\n<p>Now that the compounds are here, I strongly urge all community members to be actively involved in the upkeep and maintenance of the compounds. Your community health officers will only be able to deliver quality services if they have access to sufficient resources to keep the<br \/>\nCHPS compound running. Promoting good health in your community calls for the commitment of all stakeholders \u2014 including community members and district assembly members \u2014 to mobilize and manage financial resources. It is important that resources are managed well so<br \/>\nthese health services remain available and accessible to all members over time.<\/p>\n<p>We thank the community health officers who are so deeply committed to serving in these CHPS zones. We know that the work is difficult. Having a fully equipped CHPS compound will make it easier to provide the highest quality services \u2014 services that community members deserve to<br \/>\nreceive.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you to our partners: the Ministry of Health, Ghana Health Service, and the Northern Regional Director, as well as the District Assembly, chiefs and elders, and all the community members present here today. Your contributions will continue to ensure that every Ghanaian will have access to quality health care.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">###<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>About USAID<\/em><\/p>\n<p>USAID is the lead U.S. government agency that works to end extreme global poverty and enable resilient, democratic societies to realize their potential.
