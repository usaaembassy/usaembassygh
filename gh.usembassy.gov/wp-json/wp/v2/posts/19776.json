Today we celebrate not only the outdooring of an office, but also, more broadly, the partnership between American companies and Ghana. \u00a0Indeed, ExxonMobil\u2019s decision to open an office in Accra is a positive sign.<\/p>\n<p>ExxonMobil is joining over 100 U.S. businesses that are currently operating here in Ghana providing jobs, transferring skills, and adding value to the economy. Today we celebrate the planting of a seed of confidence in Ghana\u2019s offshore oil and gas sector.\u00a0Ayekoo! And, as supporters of ExxonMobil\u2019s decision, we in government and the private sector must ask, what can we do to help this relationship blossom?<\/p>\n<p>I may not be a botanist or a florist, but we all know there are three things every newly planted seed will need: the right soil, enough sunlight, and the proper amount of water.\u00a0 In this case, we mean the best soil for the business climate, the sunlight of transparency and open communication, and the right amount of watering in expectations. So just as plantings in a garden should be given sufficient time to mature, we must continue to nurture a healthy foundation. A healthy soil that is neither too loose nor overly restrictive is conducive to foreign direct investment, especially when policies and practices align.<\/p>\n<p>I would like to applaud the steps the Government of Ghana has taken to date to improve the ease of doing business.\u00a0 And I would like to encourage the government to continue with those reforms to ensure that the right business environment, or soil for growth, is in place. Of course, every seed also needs the proper amount of sunlight to provide clarity and to give the new seed a direction in which to grow.<\/p>\n<p>This sunlight takes the form of transparency and open communication around the vision and direction of the sector. \u00a0Consistent and reliable dialogue gives investors the confidence to continue, knowing that their concerns are heard and respected.\u00a0 In this vein, I commend the Government of Ghana for rolling out its National Petroleum Registry\u00a0and initiating its inaugural public bid round\u2013 two great initiatives that are building more transparency and predictability into the system.\u00a0 And as these initiatives grow, international and local businesses will thrive and contribute more to Ghana\u2019s growth.<\/p>\n<p>Last but not least, we must make sure to water this investment with the appropriate amount of expectation.\u00a0 A common mistake when growing a new seed, is that everyone wants the plant to hurry up and grow, so they water it and water it, eventually stifling the plant\u2019s growth.\u00a0 I have literally done this myself! Instead, I encourage all of us here today to manage the amount of water or expectations we are placing on this very young seed.<\/p>\n<p>Like the heart-shaped adinkra symbol \u201cAkoma,\u201d I am wearing today, both growing plants and developing the economy take patience and endurance. \u00a0Yes, large industry leaders like ExxonMobil play a major role, but they cannot do it all, and they cannot do it alone.<\/p>\n<p>In closing, Ladies and Gentlemen, I want to emphasize that today is worthy of celebration. Today is one step forward toward the vision that Ghana and the United States share &#8211; a Ghana where investment-led growth builds the country\u2019s capacity and drives sustainable economic and social development without relying over the long-term on development partners.\u00a0 \u00a0Together, let\u2019s keep working toward a Ghana that is strengthened through its trade and investment partnerships with American companies.<\/p>\n<p>Congratulations, once again, to ExxonMobil on the official inauguration of your Ghana office.\u00a0We will support you as we watch the seed you\u2019ve planted grow.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>ExxonMobil Office Opening Event and Reception Remarks by Ambassador Stephanie S.
