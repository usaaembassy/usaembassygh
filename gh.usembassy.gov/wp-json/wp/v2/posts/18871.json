Babs and I are proud to welcome you to our residence for a very special reception honoring the visit of Dr. Avis Jones-DeWeever under the Department of State\u2019s Africa Regional Services Speaker Program.<\/p>\n<p>The American author of the award-winning book \u201cHow Exceptional Black Women Lead,\u201d Dr. Jones-DeWeever is an expert in business strategies, diversity, and women\u2019s empowerment.\u00a0 She has also served as an ARS Speaker in several nations, including across Africa.\u00a0 As a prolific writer, she is the author or co-author of numerous publications.\u00a0 Her perspectives have been shared through a variety of American and international media sources, including CNN, BBC, The Washington Post, The Atlantic, Essence Magazine and many more.\u00a0 She currently serves as a regular contributor to The Huffington Post, Black Enterprise and NBC.\u00a0 She is also a member in several Boards of Directors.\u00a0 In what she describes as her most important role, she is a mother of two magnificent young men, who will one day, she believes, change the world.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Jones-DeWeever is in the midst of a very productive visit to Ghana that has taken her to Cape Coast, Kumasi, and Accra to promote partnership programs with women entrepreneurs and alumnae from U.S. exchange programs.\u00a0 Her leadership sessions are specifically from women for women.\u00a0 They address the unique challenges and opportunities facing Ghanaian women as leaders, job creators, and contributors to private sector growth, and how their inclusion is critical to help Ghana and the African continent attain full economic development.<\/p>\n<p>I am very pleased to see many alumnae here tonight from the Africa Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship Program (AWEP), Mandela Washington Fellows, the YALI Regional Leadership Center, Tech Women, and other exchanges.\u00a0 As I prepare to become a private citizen, I am proud to have helped shape some of these exchange programs.<\/p>\n<p>As we formulated and shaped a new U.S. foreign policy approach in Africa a few years ago, we understood that true progress in Africa could come about more effectively through the immense talents, ideas, and contributions of young African leaders in all sectors, especially women and girls.\u00a0 There can be no development anywhere, including in America and Ghana, without actively empowering women and girls to offer their best talents, ideas, and contributions to build a future of peace, security, and prosperity.\u00a0 Put simply, African solutions for African challenges.<\/p>\n<p>We also understood then as now, as former President Obama declared here in Accra in July 2009, that the continent needed to build strong institutions and enter a new era that seized opportunities offered by the 21<sup>st<\/sup> century while also retaining Africa\u2019s unique cultural heritage and traditions that have nurtured the world for centuries.<\/p>\n<p>America itself has been shaped and blessed by Africa\u2019s influence, legacy, and heritage.\u00a0 From a pained past initiated by the evil of slavery, African Americans have greatly contributed to every single sector, from politics, arts, music, culture, science, technology, and beyond.\u00a0 Africa is in our DNA, and that is why I am especially proud to welcome tonight the members of the African American Association of Ghana &#8211; the \u201ctriple A G\u201d &#8212; because they too, are American ambassadors in Ghana.\u00a0 We have partnered this year in several Black History Month Programs and Step Afrika\u2019s visit, and our work continues.\u00a0 Thank you for being essential partners in our public diplomacy programming.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Avis Jones-DeWeever\u2019s visit to Ghana demonstrates our commitment to strengthen our partnership with Ghanaian women entrepreneurs and to build on our efforts.\u00a0 We hope that through Dr. Jones-DeWeever\u2019s visit your professional networks will expand even further, and that you establish lifelong partnerships in support of your strategic business objectives.<\/p>\n<p>As women business leaders, you are at the forefront of promoting transparent business climates that attract foreign and domestic investors.\u00a0 We believe in your leadership and efforts, and salute your transformational vision to make Ghana\u2019s economy stronger, more prosperous, and beneficial to all citizens.\u00a0 I close by congratulating you for your efforts to \u201cpay forward\u201d your success by mentoring a new generation of young women aspiring to become business leaders like you.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you all for joining us here tonight.<\/p>\n<p>Let us now offer Dr. Jones-DeWeever a warm Ghanaian akwabaa!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>American business leader Dr. Avis Jones-DeWeever visited Ghana from June 16 through 22 to promote women\u2019s entrepreneurship under the
