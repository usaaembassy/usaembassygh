Since its inception, the John A. Kufuor Foundation has promoted practical and sustainable development in Ghana and on the continent of Africa.<\/p>\n<p>I applaud the Foundation for transforming this vision into action, guiding the youth towards effective leadership, good governance, and to assume civic roles as champions of socio-economic development. The Scholars gathered today, representing many regions from this diverse nation, are those future leaders who will become lawyers, medical professionals, economists, engineers, professors, and diplomats.\u00a0 Maybe even a future President, and I wish him or her well!<\/p>\n<p>The American actor Will Rogers said, \u201cThe farmer has to be an optimist or he wouldn&#8217;t still be a farmer.\u201d\u00a0 The same can be said of teachers and mentors working with young people and planting the seeds for tomorrow\u2019s harvest.<\/p>\n<p>Empowering youth is at the heart of the U.S.-Africa relationship.\u00a0 Across the continent, the United States partners with national and local governments, civil society organizations, and citizens from all walks of life to advance the mutually beneficial goals of prosperity, good governance, and long-term stability.\u00a0 Youth engagement is crucial in pursuit of these mutually reinforcing efforts.<\/p>\n<p>For those who have just graduated, Ayikoo!<\/p>\n<p>I encourage you to consider pursuing an undergraduate or graduate degree program in the United States.\u00a0 Over 3,200 Ghanaian students studied at 630 American colleges and universities in the 2018-2019 academic year. Ghana is currently the third-highest sender of students from sub-Saharan Africa to the United States, after Kenya and Nigeria.\u00a0 We\u2019d love to see those numbers increase!<\/p>\n<p>We have two EducationUSA advising centers \u2013 one here in Accra and one in Kumasi.\u00a0 Our centers promote U.S. higher education to students by offering accurate, comprehensive, and current information about opportunities to study at accredited post-secondary institutions in the United States.\u00a0 In fact, this coming Friday, September 27, we will host the EducationUSA College Fair at Presec Legon from 11:00am &#8211; 4:00pm.\u00a0 I encourage those of you who are interested to attend, where you can meet with representatives from 50 American colleges and universities.<\/p>\n<p>Today, as we celebrate this graduating KSP class, I can already see that this initiative is well on its way to creating a lasting legacy.\u00a0 This program encourages you to think beyond your individual pursuits for the greater good of your communities, both local and global.<\/p>\n<p>For example, last year, Kufuor Scholars \u2013Now recipients of the Presidential Award &#8211; Felicity Yeboah Dokyi, Norbert Kwame Agbemenu, and Edem Kojo Doe attended a University Leadership Conference in my country, in Chicago, Illinois.\u00a0While there, they competed for and won $5,000 in seed funding for the Menarche Initiative that Nana Ama just told us about. The three Scholars I just mentioned are indeed exceptional &#8211; and clearly not the exception \u2013 in this Kufuor Scholars program.\u00a0 I\u2019ve enjoyed learning more about the many accomplishments members of this graduating Cohort have achieved in the past three years, and I look forward to hearing about more great things.<\/p>\n<p>But \u2013 ah beg &#8211; don\u2019t follow only the safe and easy path to where you know you will succeed. Take risks, try something new, and push beyond your comfort zone. <strong>Consider what some might call failure, as a learning opportunity<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Allow me to share a personal \u201clearning opportunity.\u201d In secondary school, having been selected without much effort to play violin for the All-County Orchestra on my first attempt, I showed up, overconfident and underprepared, for my audition the following year. I regret to say I had hardly, if at all, practiced the piece I was to play. After I had scratched my way painfully though the assigned score, the judge peered over his glasses and asked, \u201cDid you say you were in the all-county orchestra last year?\u201d When I proudly replied \u201cWhy, yes, yes I was,\u201d he asked \u201cAre you sure??\u201d\u00a0 Needless to say, that was the end of the audition;\u00a0 I was not selected. This experience taught me to over-prepare.<\/p>\n<p>To Hashtag 2022, you were chosen because of your potential to develop into leaders.\u00a0 Take every opportunity to learn and make the most of this program. And to Hashtag 2019, you are now better equipped to change others\u2019 lives for the better.\u00a0 You all play a key role in developing the next generation of leaders and channeling their talents, passions, and potential in a positive direction.\u00a0 It is time for the mentees to become the mentors.<\/p>\n<p>As you assume greater leadership responsibilities, <strong>be persistent.\u00a0 <\/strong>Never give up in the face of adversity, for few successes come without setbacks.\u00a0 In fact, on my journey to becoming a diplomat, I took the Foreign Service Examination not once, not twice, but three times before I finally passed.\u00a0 If I had given up, I would not be standing here before you today as the U.S. Ambassador to Ghana.\u00a0 Remember the Ghanaian proverb: \u201cThe wasp says that several regular trips to a mud pit enables it to build a house.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Cultivate resilience. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I have played soccer for decades, including here at Indadfa Park in Mamprobi with the Potscom Ladies when I served in Ghana before. I often played goalie.\u00a0 The best goalie in the world is not going to get a shutout every match. Inevitably, many balls will get past you into the net. It does not mean you have no talent!\u00a0 After a setback on the field or in life, you must collect yourself, resume your concentration, and stay in the game, for your own sake and the good of your team. Finally, as you go forward in your endeavors, <strong>do so with integrity<\/strong>. In my line of work, in positions of public trust and as stewards of taxpayers\u2019 hard-earned dollars,\u00a0 we actively consider whether our actions would pass what we call \u201cthe Washington Post test.\u201d Here, we could call it \u201cthe Daily Graphic test.\u201d We stop and think, \u201cWhat would happen if this got leaked to The Washington Post newspaper?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To conclude, let me leave you with these thoughts: learn from your experiences, be persistent, and cultivate resilience. I wish all of you the best of luck, whether you are just starting your leadership journey or moving on to enter the professional world. Act with integrity in all you do, and develop into a mentor to those who follow. And may we all stand on the shoulders of our visionary ancestors. Thank you!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Joint Induction\/Graduation Ceremony of Kufuor Scholars \u201cTransforming Africa through Leadership with Integrity\u201d Remarks by U.S. Ambassador to Ghana Stephanie S.
