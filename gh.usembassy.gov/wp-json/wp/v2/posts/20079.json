My husband John and I are happy to welcome you all, following what I hear has been a very successful college fair today.\u00a0As both a former student and a former teacher, I am excited to be among this incredible group of educators, students, school administrators, and admissions representatives.<\/p>\n<p>All of you here this evening represent the strong people-to-people ties between Ghana and the United States. I am delighted to see this growing interest on the part of both the Ghanaians who are interested in studying in the United States, and the representatives from nearly 50 U.S. colleges and universities who came here to meet with prospective students.<\/p>\n<p>This evening is meant to be an informal and fun networking session, so let me take a few moments to acknowledge the various groups present tonight in addition to the representatives of the 50 American colleges and universities.<\/p>\n<p>We have directors, school heads, teachers, and counselors from senior high schools, including the host for today\u2019s college fair, Presbyterian Boys SHS, also known as Presec.\u00a0 This group is one of our best resources when it comes to reaching Ghanaian students for undergraduate programs in the United States.\u00a0 Presec grants our EdUSA advisors access to its students and provides guidance to students who show promise for academic study abroad.<\/p>\n<p>Also present are secondary high school teachers who are alumni of the International Leaders in Education (ILEP) and Fulbright Teaching Excellence and Achievement (TEA) programs.\u00a0 These outstanding secondary school teachers have been recognized for their leadership in the classroom and beyond and have been selected to participate in teacher development and training in the United States.\u00a0 They, too, support our Embassy EdUSA advisors to reach key student populations with information about study in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>We have our recently arrived cohort of American Fulbright students, research scholars, and visiting lecturers (professors).\u00a0 Fulbright is one of the United States\u2019 longest standing and most prestigious academic exchange programs.<\/p>\n<p>We are honored to have such a talented group of Americans who are connected to research institutions and universities throughout Ghana, helping forge collaborative research and teaching among American and Ghanaian institutions of higher education.<\/p>\n<p>And finally, we have Ghanaian university administrators and faculty who host the American Fulbrighters, and who create and sustain linkages among American and Ghanaian universities.\u00a0 They also help our EdUSA advisors promote graduate and post-graduate studies in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier this week, I wrote an op-ed that highlight the many ways our U.S. Mission in Ghana is working hand-in-hand with Ghanaians to boost education at the primary, secondary, and higher education levels. Today\u2019s college fair and this EducationUSA reception are examples of our partnership with Ghana on education.<\/p>\n<p>Did you know that over 3,200 Ghanaian students studied at 630 U.S. colleges and universities in the past academic year? Ghana is now the third-highest sender of students from sub-Saharan Africa to the United States, after Kenya and Nigeria.\u00a0 I\u2019m confident that with the work you have all done today, we\u2019ll see those numbers increase!<\/p>\n<p>We look forward to continuing our partnership for education with Ghana.\u00a0 A robust economy depends on much more than a nation\u2019s natural wealth and resources.\u00a0 Access to quality education is a pre-condition for equitable economic growth, improving critical health indicators, and advancing gender equality. Indeed, a prosperous and stable Ghana is good for both Ghana and the United States \u2013 and it all starts with education.<\/p>\n<p>This evening you\u2019ll meet new and interesting people who share the goal of increasing our two countries\u2019 educational exchanges and partnerships.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you again for coming, and I leave you with the African saying, \u201cThe path to a friend\u2019s home is never far.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>EducationUSA Networking Reception \u00a0Remarks by U.S. Ambassador Stephanie Sullivan Chief of Mission Residence September 27, 2019 | 6:30pm \u2013 8:00pm Good evening everyone!
