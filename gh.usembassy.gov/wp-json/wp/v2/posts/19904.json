Gifty Twum-Ampofo<\/p>\n<p>Representatives of Other Volunteer Corps<\/p>\n<p>Representatives of the Media<\/p>\n<p>Colleagues<\/p>\n<p>Distinguished Guests<\/p>\n<p>I am very pleased to administer the oath of service to these 23 U.S. citizens today. They have completed 10 weeks of training and are now prepared to transition to being Peace Corps Volunteers.<\/p>\n<p>The trainees taking the oath today will join nearly 5,000 other Americans who have served as Peace Corps Volunteers in Ghana over the past 58 years.\u00a0 While this ceremony today recognizes this group, it is also a tribute to the legacy of earlier Volunteers.\u00a0 It is a tribute to the long, unbroken record of Volunteers working alongside Ghanaians \u2014 engaged in development challenges and increasing mutual understanding, goodwill and friendship.<\/p>\n<p>Even though it has been 58 years, this relationship continues to thrive, and remains highly valued by both countries.\u00a0 Volunteers\u2019 work has changed over the years in response to evolving development challenges. Regardless of the nature of the challenges, Volunteers are highly effective working at the grassroots level \u2014 in communities throughout Ghana, and with organizations that work on a daily basis to improve the lives of the Ghanaian people.<\/p>\n<p>Our ideas and ideals \u2014 expressed through individuals working in partnership \u2014 have extraordinary impact.\u00a0 I see this every day in our development programs in Ghana, where we change and save lives through our agriculture, education, governance, health, water and sanitation, and security programs.\u00a0 I see it in the exchange programs we facilitate, including the U. S. Government\u2019s Young African Leaders Initiative.\u00a0 Under the flagship program, the Mandela Washington Fellowship, young leaders from Africa hone their skills at U. S. colleges and universities, and return to the continent to craft solutions \u2014 in Africa, for Africa, by Africans.\u00a0 We follow the principle of helping people gain the capacity to help themselves.\u00a0 Peace Corps is at the front line of that work.<\/p>\n<p>We do this because a stable, prosperous and democratic Ghana is good for Ghanaians and good for America.<\/p>\n<p>Our Peace Corps Volunteers are among the best and brightest that the United States has to offer.\u00a0\u00a0 While they are here \u2014while you are here, you will serve as grassroots ambassadors.\u00a0 Working diligently in your communities, you will touch lives in unimaginable ways. Through your actions and attitudes, your service and your kindness to others, you will show that Americans care deeply about Ghanaians and are committed to work side-by-side for the long term.\u00a0\u00a0 You will make clear in a tangible way how much we respect and cherish our relationship with Ghana.\u00a0 In fact, you have already done so by taking your Pre-Service training seriously and immersing yourselves in the lives of your host families.<\/p>\n<p>The Peace Corps staff has done its best to give you the tools to be effective agents of change and to link communities to development resources.\u00a0\u00a0 But those tools \u2014 the training, the language, the cross cultural exchanges \u2014 are just that: tools.\u00a0 \u00a0YOU are the change agents.\u00a0 You are the ones who can decide to put in that extra effort to develop relationships and gain community acceptance of new ideas.\u00a0 You can find new approaches and new knowledge that will help make your community a more productive and happier place.\u00a0 The people you interact with will help shape the future of this country, and they<em> will<\/em> remember you.<\/p>\n<p>About 20 years ago, Sargent Shriver, the brother-in-law of President Kennedy and first director of the Peace Corps, spoke to the graduating class at Yale University.\u00a0\u00a0 As these students embarked on their new lives, just as you are embarking on yours, he told them:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI hope your remember to believe in things until you die.\u00a0 I hope you remember to be guided by beliefs powerful enough to change the world.\u00a0\u00a0 I hope you remember the example of the Peace Corps Volunteer, the Head Start parent, the Special Olympics athlete.\u00a0 They, each in their own way are waging peace\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>I challenge you today: Wage peace.\u00a0 Make a difference \u2026. One person at a time.\u00a0 You may never be in a better position to do so.\u00a0 And your impact will live on long after your service in Ghana ends.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Congratulations. You are now Peace Corps Volunteers! <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Swearing-In Ceremony for Peace Corps Education Volunteers Remarks by Charg\u00e9 D\u2019Affaires Christopher Lamora\u00a0 Thursday, August 8, 2019 \u00a0 Honorable Deputy Minister of Education, Hon.
