Prichard &#8211; CRIMJUST Global Coordinator;<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Kameldy Neldjingaye &#8211; UNODC Deputy Regional Director for West &amp; Central Africa;<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Francis Torkornoo &#8211; Director General of Ghana Narcotics Control Commission;<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Charles Abani &#8211; UN-Resident Coordinator in Ghana;<\/p>\n<p>Partners, colleagues, ladies, and gentlemen:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Good morning!<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m very pleased to be here with you this morning and would like to extend my thanks to the UNODC Crim-just Global Program for asking me to be part of today\u2019s event.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d also like to thank the wide range of Ghanaian government officials present and engaged on this issue, which demonstrates the inter-ministerial and interagency cooperation required to reduce illicit opioid production and trafficking.<\/p>\n<p>The use and abuse of opioids is a global epidemic.\u00a0 And global challenges require global solutions.\u00a0 The United States, through the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, is pleased to support Operation Azure, an international effort to enhance operational activities to prevent trafficking of synthetic opioids.<\/p>\n<p>U.S. communities know firsthand and practically every family in American has a story to tell about the devastating effects of fentanyl and heroin from overseas and some that is produced in the United States.\u00a0 Approximately 93,000 Americans lost their lives from drug overdoses in 2020.<\/p>\n<p>And sadly, the scourge of synthetic drugs is a global phenomenon. \u00a0According to the World Health Organization \u2013 an organization that the United States proudly rejoined some months again \u2013 in 2019, worldwide, there were 350,000 deaths attributed to opioid use.\u00a0 We know that here in Ghana, and throughout the region, the abuse of tramadol and other pharmaceuticals is a growing problem.<\/p>\n<p>Combatting synthetic opioids poses significant challenges due to the ease with which they can be produced and trafficked across borders.\u00a0 \u00a0Today\u2019s model of drug trafficking involves deadly products sent globally through legitimate shipping and mail services.\u00a0 Criminal organizations are seizing the opportunity to profit, particularly when it comes to super-potent synthetics like fentanyl. \u00a0Operation Azure focuses on mitigating vulnerabilities in the global postal system and building capacity to investigate and successfully prosecute violations.\u00a0 The operation will involve training a full range of government interagency \u2013 police, narcotics control, revenue authority, judges, and prosecutors \u2013 to reduce illicit opioid production and trafficking.<\/p>\n<p>Operation Azure was developed as part of UNODC\u2019s Opioid Strategy and will put into practice guidelines and best practices on both sides of the Atlantic to stop and prosecute those involved in this deadly trade.<\/p>\n<p>While illicit synthetic opioids are by far the deadliest new drugs we are all up against, the use of other internationally trafficked drugs, like cocaine and methamphetamine, remains a devastating problem in the United States and, indeed, around the world.<\/p>\n<p>In order to successfully battle drug trafficking and transnational crime, we must work together more effectively than the criminals who we are trying to stop.\u00a0 The United States knows we cannot go it alone and that\u2019s why President Biden recommitted to multilateral cooperation at the beginning of his term.<\/p>\n<p>We are grateful to partners like UNODC who lead cross-cutting efforts like Operation Azure. \u00a0Our partnership and cooperation across borders are our greatest strength.<\/p>\n<p>I look forward to hearing success stories coming from this operation. \u00a0Medaase!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ambassador Sullivan\u2019s Remarks at the UNODC Launch Friday, September 17, 2021 10:50 a.m.
