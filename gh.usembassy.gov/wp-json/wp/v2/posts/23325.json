Partners from the media, academia, and civil society are deliberating on the theme \u201cShaping a Future of Rights: Freedom of expression as a driver for all other human rights.\u201d Our own Secretary of State Antony Blinken will commemorate this important day later when he helps launch the 2023 World Press Freedom Index.<\/p>\n<p>A free press is one of the most vital ingredients for any functioning democracy.\u00a0 For this reason, the Founding Fathers of the United States ensured that freedom of expression was the very first guarantee of our constitution.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also why the media are often referred to as the Fourth Estate.\u00a0 There may be three branches of government in democracies like the United States and Ghana- but where would we be if there were not objective journalists and investigative reporters to hold our elected leaders accountable?\u00a0 And who are free to represent a range of viewpoints on behalf of all citizens.<\/p>\n<p>A free, vibrant, and independent media is crucial. The U.S. Embassy continues to support media development institutions to build the capacity of Ghanaian journalists in fact checking, investigative journalism, reporting on people with disabilities, and media literacy programs for young Ghanaians to improve their appetite for news and credible information.<\/p>\n<p>The Embassy\u2019s grant to the Department of Communication, University of Ghana in support of \u201cState of the Ghanaian Media report\u201d is one clear example of our ardent commitment to support Ghanaian media. \u00a0Aspects of the report included working conditions in media, media ownership, journalists\u2019 safety.\u00a0 I recommend it to you as a useful roadmap for guiding our way forward to support journalists.<\/p>\n<p>In 2020, the U.S Embassy supported the Alliance for Women in Media Africa (AWMA) and the School of Information and Communication Studies at the University of Ghana\u00a0 to launch \u201cthe Status of Women in the Ghanaian Media\u201d report, again providing evidence for advocacy and support.\u00a0 Based on a nationwide study of newsrooms, the report presented an overview of the profile of women in the Ghanaian media including the positions they occupy, career progression opportunities, their challenges and experiences with issues of harassment and other human right abuses.<\/p>\n<p>The findings in these two reports are catalysts for development organizations in the industry, government, academia, and consumers of news to spur improvements.<\/p>\n<p>We are currently witnessing a situation where media freedom, freedom of expression, as well other human rights, are increasingly under attack. \u00a0Journalists\u2019 safety is of major concern as was stipulated in the State of Ghanaian Media Report.\u00a0 As the report correctly points out, journalists must be protected.\u00a0 Just as the public can be protected from misinformation by strong civil liability laws.<\/p>\n<p>Journalism provides us all a platform for informed discussion across a range of issues \u2013 including governance and corruption, environmental challenges, gender equality, youth engagement and peacebuilding. Only when journalists are at liberty to monitor, investigate and criticize policies and actions can good governance exist.<\/p>\n<p>Today we applaud the work of you \u2013 the Fourth Estate \u2013 and your colleagues around the world.\u00a0 Thank you for the important role you are fulfilling to keep the people informed.<\/p>\n<p>As we mark this 30th anniversary, we call on all stakeholders to refocus on freedom of expression as a vital precondition for the enjoyment of all other human rights. \u00a0As Thomas Jefferson once said \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.azquotes.com\/quote\/354452?ref=freedom-of-the-press\">Our liberty depends on the freedom of the press, and that cannot be limited without being lost\u201d.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>PAO Ginny Elliott REMARKS WORLD PRESS FREEDOM DAY EVENT PRESS CENTRE, ACCRA MAY 03, 2023 TIME:\u00a0 10.00am Good morning!\u00a0 On behalf of Ambassador Palmer and the U.S. Embassy, I\u2019m so pleased to celebrate with you today as we mark the 30th anniversary since the UN declaration of World Press Freedom Day.\u00a0 I salute all our &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1058,"featured_media":23327,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_gpalab_slo_mission_select":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[44,54],"tags":[10018],"class_list":["post-23325","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-press-releases","category-speeches","tag-world-press-freedom-day"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) -
