I can smell the fresh paint! LuccaHealth\u2019s internationally certified Medical Specialty Center will provide Accra with world class services in line with Ghana\u2019s rising demand for medical care. However, today\u2019s opening is not just about better services, it\u2019s also about a commitment to a stronger Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>We all know that healthy families raise children who perform better in school. Healthy workers contribute more to the economy. That\u2019s why the U.S. private sector and U.S. government<br \/>\nare pleased to support Ghana\u2019s vision for a stronger health sector.<\/p>\n<p>The United States, through the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (or OPIC), is pleased to have provided $7.5 million in financing to help LuccaHealth and its U.S. parent company, BlackIvy, launch this amazing project to benefit Ghana\u2019s expanding healthcare market. LuccaHealth\u2019s business model brings physicians and head nurses with illustrious careers to Ghana, and gives them a place to thrive in their practice.<\/p>\n<p>During their multi-year assignments, these renowned medical professionals provide Ghana\u2019s medical professionals with a wealth of experience sourced from across the globe<br \/>\nwhile working side by side in this internationally certified facility. There is a saying that \u201cA worthy cause is worth pursuing to the end.\u201d (a-DI-ya e-YE, na eh-FA-tah no, eh wiryeh YEH).<\/p>\n<p>Today we celebrate the realization of a dream. Bringing internationally recognized experts to Ghana\u2019s shores is an opportunity to share learning opportunities with local nurses and doctors without their needing to leave home. And U.S. financial assistance to this project will help expand this innovative knowledge-sharing model.<\/p>\n<p>The United States considers promoting the health and well-being of Ghana\u2019s citizens a high priority. In the past few weeks, I have been pleased to participate in several events demonstrating the strong partnership between us in the health sector: I participated in the launch of a medical delivery drone distribution center in Mampong, in the Ashanti Region,<br \/>\nthe second such center established by the American company Zipline, which delivers life-saving emergency supplies such as blood and antivenin to rural clinics.<\/p>\n<p>While there I also highlighted the collaboration between the United States and the Ministry of Health, the Ghana Health Service, and the Global Fund to strengthen Ghana\u2019s supply chain system through \u201clast mile\u201d delivery and electronic logistics management, including Ghana\u2019s Integrated Logistics Management Information System, also known as GhiLMIS.<br \/>\nIn addition, earlier this month, in partnership with the Republic of Ghana and UNAIDS, I helped launch our joint strategy to achieve HIV epidemic control in the Western Region over the next 12 months.<\/p>\n<p>My team and I at the U.S. Embassy are pleased to continue recognizing the great partnerships between U.S. companies and Ghana\u2019s citizens. Whether the partnership is government-to-government, or purely between private-sector actors, the United States looks forward to our continued commitment to Ghana\u2019s health sector.<\/p>\n<p>I wish LuccaHealth and the community all the best, and congratulate you once again on this welcome project. Ayekoo! Thank you.
