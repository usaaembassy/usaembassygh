and the fact-based reporting they produce means the public can play an active role in development and policy decisions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Just like the United States, Ghana has a law that, effectively implemented, can facilitate quality journalism: the Right to Information Law.\u00a0 This law is helping Ghanaian journalists and community leaders gather crucial information from local authorities, government agencies, and the national government.\u00a0 This flow of information is also critical for public policy decision making.\u00a0 As we learned in the United States with our Freedom of Information Act, sometimes light is the best disinfectant.\u00a0 And, if you\u2019ll permit me to continue, it\u2019s that light that holds governments accountable and serves to fight corruption.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">I know that the State of the Ghanaian Media Report being released today will touch on many of these issues.\u00a0 As the professor said, the job is not done \u2013 this is just the first step.\u00a0 I hope the report serves as a catalyst for media houses, universities, media support organizations, and governments to shape their programs, training, and policies to ensure that we all support a professional, responsible, and accountable media here in Ghana.\u00a0 Thank you for your kind attention.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Deputy Chief of Mission Nicole Chulick\u2019s Remarks Launch of the State of Ghanaian Media Report University of Ghana April 19, 2023 10:45 a.m. &nbsp;
