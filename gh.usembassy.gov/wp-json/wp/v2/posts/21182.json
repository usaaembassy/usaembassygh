><\/div><p><b>Accra,\u00a0GHANA<\/b>\u2014 Demonstrating the strong people-to-people and educational ties between the United States and Ghana, the number of Ghanaians studying in the United States continues a strong upward trend.\u00a0 The Institute for International Education releases their Open Doors report annually during International Education Week, celebrated this year from November 16-20.\u00a0 On a positive note, the 2020 report has shown a 15.3% increase during the 2019-20 academic year in the number of Ghanaian students attending universities and colleges in the United States over the previous year.\u00a0 Ghana retains the number two spot in sub-Saharan Africa, with the number of Ghanaian students increasing from 3,661 to 4,221.\u00a0 The number one spot is held by Nigeria, with a 2.5% increase from 13,423 in 2018-19 to 13,762 students in 2019-20.<\/p>\n<p>According to the 2020 Open Doors Report, the United States hosted over 1 million international students for the fifth consecutive year.\u00a0 Sub-Saharan Africa continues to represent an area of growth, with 41,697 students in 2019-20, marking a 3.5 % increase over the prior year.\u00a0 Amidst declining numbers of international study in other regions, sub-Saharan Africa stands out for its percentage of growth.\u00a0 The giants of West Africa, Ghana, and Nigeria, contributed significantly to the increased numbers in the region.<\/p>\n<p>Notably, nearly half of the Ghanaian students in the United States are studying at the graduate level, and this number increased by 22% over last year, from 1,860 to 2,270.\u00a0 As a result, Ghana moved from the ranking of 25 to 21<sup>\u00a0<\/sup>in terms of the highest sending countries worldwide for graduate studies in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>The five most popular U.S. states for Ghanaian students are Ohio, New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, and Michigan.<\/p>\n<p>More than half of all international students pursued majors in the STEM fields, while other popular fields of study include business and management, social sciences, health professions, and foreign language and international studies.\u00a0 For additional information on the 2020
