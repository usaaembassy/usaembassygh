><\/div><p>Honorable Minister of Health<br \/>\nHonorable Eastern Regional Minister,<br \/>\nHonorable Municipal Chief Executive,<br \/>\nAnd our many other distinguished guests, especially our homestay parents:<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In February, my wife, Babs, and I had the pleasure of hosting a welcome reception at our residence for this group of health trainees.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>It was just one day after they arrived in Ghana.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>There was excitement in the air and a few nerves, as well.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Today, I am very pleased to administer the oath of service to these 22 U.S. citizens.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>They have completed 10 weeks of training and are now prepared to transition to being Peace Corps Volunteers.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Trainees taking the oath today will join nearly 5,000 other Americans who have served as Peace Corps Volunteers in Ghana over the past 56 years.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>While this ceremony today recognizes this group, it is also a tribute to the legacy of earlier Volunteers.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>It is a tribute to the long, unbroken record of Volunteers working alongside Ghanaians \u2014 engaged in development challenges and increasing mutual understanding, goodwill and friendship.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I am pleased to note that the relationship continues to thrive and remains highly valued by both countries.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Volunteers\u2019 work has changed over the years in response to evolving development challenges.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>But regardless of the nature of the challenges, Volunteers have always been most effective when working at the grassroots level \u2014 in communities like this one and with organizations that work on a daily basis to improve the lives of the Ghanaian people.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Our ideas and <i>ideals <\/i>\u2014 expressed through individuals working in partnership \u2014 can have extraordinary impact.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>I see this every day in our development programs in Ghana, where we change and save lives through our agriculture; education; and health, water and sanitation programs.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>I see it in the exchange programs we facilitate, including the U.S. government\u2019s Young African Leaders Initiative, also called YALI.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Under the flagship program, the Mandela Washington Fellowship, young leaders from Africa hone their skills at U.S. colleges and universities and return to the continent to craft solutions \u2014 in Africa, for Africa, by Africans.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>We follow the principle of helping people gain strength to help themselves.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Peace Corps is at the front line of that work.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As Peace Corps Volunteers, you are among the best and brightest that the United States has to offer; while you are here, you will serve as grassroots ambassadors.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Working diligently in your communities, at your sites, you will touch lives in unimaginable ways.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Through your actions and attitudes, your service and your kindness to others, you will show that Americans care deeply about Ghanaians and are committed to work side-by-side for the long term.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>You will make clear in a tangible way how much we respect and cherish our relationship with Ghana.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>In fact, you have already done so by taking your Pre-Service Training seriously and immersing yourselves in the lives of your host families.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Peace Corps Ghana staff has done its best to give you the tools to be effective agents of change and to link communities to development resources.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>But those tools \u2014 the training, the language, the cross cultural exchanges \u2014 are just that: tools.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>YOU are the change agents.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>You are the ones who can decide to put in that extra effort to develop relationships and gain community acceptance of new ideas.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>You can find new approaches and new knowledge that will help make your community a more productive and happier place.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>The people you interact with will help shape the future of this country, and they will remember you.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">About 20 years ago, Sargent Shriver, the brother-in-law of President Kennedy and first director of the Peace Corps, spoke to the graduating class at Yale University.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>As these students embarked on their new lives, just as you are embarking on yours, he told them:<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\u201cI hope you remember to believe in things until you die.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>I hope you remember to be guided by beliefs powerful enough to change the world.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>I hope you remember the example of the Peace Corps Volunteer, the Head Start parent, the Special Olympics athlete.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>They, each in their own way, are waging peace.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I challenge you today:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Wage peace.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Make a difference \u2026 one person at a time.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>You may never be in a better position to do so.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>And your impact will live on long after your service in Ghana ends.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Please rise for the oath.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I, (State your name), solemnly swear (or affirm)<br \/>\nthat I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States<br \/>\nagainst all enemies, foreign and domestic,<br \/>\nand that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same,<br \/>\nthat I take this obligation freely,<br \/>\nwithout any mental reservation or purpose of evasion,<br \/>\nand that I will well and faithfully discharge<br \/>\nmy duties in the Peace Corps, (so help me God).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Congratulations.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>You are now Peace Corps Volunteers!<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Now, you will take the Peace Corps Volunteer Pledge.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Thank you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Honorable Minister of Health Honorable Eastern Regional Minister, Honorable Municipal
