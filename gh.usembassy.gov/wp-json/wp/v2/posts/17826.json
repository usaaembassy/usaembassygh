Topics discussed included international best practices and case studies on renewable integration; energy planning processes to support long-term development; and emerging business models.\u00a0 The aim of the event was to enhance the capability of the Ghanaian power sector to address the challenges of integrating renewable energy resources like wind, solar and hydropower in the national grid.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn 2013, the U.S. government launched the Power Africa Initiative to increase energy access in Sub-Saharan Africa. Together with our partners, we work to add new generation capacity, connect homes, hospitals and businesses to the electricity grid and deliver power to communities who live beyond the national grid,\u201d remarked Mr. Hendrix. \u201cScaling up renewable energy is critical to our agenda of delivering power to all Ghanaian citizens. Through the power of partnership we are leveraging private sector investment to provide renewable energy solutions that will build Ghana\u2019s power sector for years to come.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This event was organized under the U.S government\u2019s Power Africa Initiative, which aims to support energy sector development on the continent. Through Power Africa, USAID works in partnership with the Ghana Government to enhance energy efficiency and encourage the use of renewable energy.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Accra, GHANA\u2014 The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Ministry of Energy hosted a workshop to discuss increasing electricity access in Ghana on\u00a0August 8-10, 2017.
