Using assessment findings, USAID developed solutions to mitigate pandemic-related supply chain and agribusiness service disruptions.\u00a0 USAID distributed personal protective equipment and hygiene kits to 22,650 farmers and conducted COVID-19 sensitization campaigns in communities and by radio; established a relief grant program that provided farm inputs such as fertilizer to 1,000 smallholder farmers; promoted and linked farmers to locally-bred seed varieties; restored disrupted ploughing services for smallholder farmers; supported over 80 outgrower businesses in their loan applications to access a portion of the 600 million cedi Coronavirus Alleviation Program &#8211; Business Support Scheme fund; and provided mobile phones to 400 women smallholder farmers to increase their access to digital information and strengthen their networks.<\/p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">The United States continues to lead the global COVID-19 pandemic response. These efforts are made possible through the American people\u2019s generosity.\u00a0\u00a0In Ghana, the United States has provided almost $19 million to address immediate impacts of COVID-19 by helping to strengthen health systems and to continue to improve reading outcomes.<\/p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">ADVANCE II is the flagship activity under Feed the Future, a U.S. government initiative to end global hunger.\u00a0 The seven-year, $41.6 million project, ADVANCE II is implemented by international development non-profit organization, ACDI\/VOCA, in the Northern, North East, Upper East, and Upper West Regions of Ghana.\u00a0 The project aims to strengthen market systems and build the capacity of outgrower businesses who are commercial farmers, aggregators and traders in providing agribusiness services to smallholder farmers.\u00a0 ADVANCE II also facilitates market linkages between the outgrower business and input suppliers, equipment dealers, financial institutions, processing firms, end buyers and other relevant value chain actors.\u00a0 Since its inception in 2014, the activity provided critical support to increase\u00a0the average yields of maize (by 307%), rice (by 114%), and soybean (176%).\u00a0 The activity also increased the volume of produce sold by 987,322 metric tons, resulting in total incremental sales valued at over $146 million.\u00a0 ADVANCE II also helped increase smallholder farmers\u2019 gross margins by 112% (from $278 to $589) for maize, 254% (from $256 to $906) for rice, and 96% (from $290 to $569) for soybean.<\/p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: center\">###<\/p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><b>About Feed the Future<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Feed the Future is the U.S. Government\u2019s initiative to end global hunger.
