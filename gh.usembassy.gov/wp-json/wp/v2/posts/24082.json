The Professionals Engaged Against Conflict &amp; Endangerment (PEACE) program, implemented by Ghana-based Emerging Public Leaders, will provide professional development and leadership training over a one-year period for 25 public servants. As part of the United States\u2019 Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability, the program is focused on improving the delivery of government services in Northern Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne of the best ways to prevent conflict and support peace is to improve the delivery and reach of public services. That\u2019s one reason why we\u2019re investing in our partnership with Ghana\u2019s public servants,\u201d said U.S. Embassy Press Attach\u00e9 Kevin Brosnahan at this week\u2019s launch.<\/p>\n<p>The program began in March 2024 with online professional development and training for more than 100 public safety professionals from various ministries and government agencies. Of those, 25 high-performing public servants have been selected for the year-long PEACE fellowship. Over the next year, they will learn best practices for security-civilian relations, to strengthen public safety and security, build trust and confidence with local communities, and help prevent conflict in the Upper East, North East, and Northern regions of Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>The participants include employees of the Ghana Police Service, Ghana Ambulance Service, Ghana Immigration Service, and Ghana Fire Service drawn from the Upper East, North East, and Northern Regions of Ghana. The Foundation for Security and Development in Africa (FOSDA) and the Ministry of Interior are partners in the program.<\/p>\n<p>Through multi-year implementation of the U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability, the U.S. Government is working across Coastal West Africa to promote social cohesion, inclusive economic growth, and accountable governance with at-risk communities in order to prevent conflict.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tamale, Northern Region, Ghana \u2013 The U.S. Embassy and Emerging Public Leaders together this week began training public servants working in Ghana\u2019s public safety sector.
