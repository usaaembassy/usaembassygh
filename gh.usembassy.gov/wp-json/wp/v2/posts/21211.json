Countries around the world, including Ghana, have benefited significantly from this long-term partnership.<\/p>\n<p>Since 2008, through PEPFAR, the American people have provided approximately $140 million dollars to help Ghana prevent the spread of HIV and ensure sustained health of those living with the virus through effective treatment. Today, those infected with HIV can lead healthy and productive lives as long as they know their positive status and start and continue to take the treatment. The good news is that treatment that suppresses the amount of the virus detected in a patient\u2019s blood actually prevents the transmission of the HIV virus to others! Undetectable equals untransmissible. Remember: U=U!<\/p>\n<p>But effective treatment is only part of the solution. Stigma and discrimination toward people living with HIV often cause people to avoid getting tested, disclosing their status, seeking treatment, and staying on the lifesaving medication that will also stop the spread of the disease to others.\u00a0 When a member of our community is stigmatized or unable to access services, it threatens their livelihood, the health of their families, and the broader community.\u00a0 We must continue to end stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV.\u00a0 They are our family members, neighbors, and friends.<\/p>\n<p>Together with our partners, we support the Government of Ghana\u2019s HIV\/AIDS response to ensure that Ghanaians overcome stigma and discrimination and have access to quality HIV testing and treatment services. During the last 12 months, PEPFAR supported the Government of Ghana to test 121,332 people; diagnose 5,321 HIV-positive people; and initiate antiretroviral therapy for 4,502 people.<\/p>\n<p>The theme of this year\u2019s World AIDS Day is \u201cGlobal Solidarity, Shared Responsibility\u201d and Ghana has adopted the theme: \u201cStay Safe, Let\u2019s End AIDS by 2030.\u201d\u00a0 These two themes essentially mean that no one is safe until everyone is safe and that we must all work together to bring an end to HIV\/AIDS.\u00a0 When people living with HIV feel secure and have uninterrupted access to HIV treatment, we\u2019re helping to keep them, as well as ourselves and our communities safe.<\/p>\n<p>We look forward to continuing our work together to ensure that Ghana achieves its vision of ending AIDS by 2030.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Accra, GHANA\u2014The United States, through the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), joined with the government of Ghana to commemorate international World AIDS Day 2020.\u00a0 Both nations noted the positive progress made to reach the goal of an HIV-free generation under the theme \u201cStay Safe, Let\u2019s End AIDS by 2030.\u201d On November 30, PEPFAR &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1058,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_gpalab_slo_mission_select":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[4,1167,44,61,4007],"tags":[7136,7036,7034],"class_list":["post-21211","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-ambassador","category-pepfar","category-press-releases","category-us-and-gh","category-usaid","tag-ambassador-sullivan","tag-pepfar","tag-world-aids-day"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) -
