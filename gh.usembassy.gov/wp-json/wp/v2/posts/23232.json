The U.S. funding will support the digitization of NHIA processes, make available the Scheme\u2019s performance data, and will ensure that health services delivery is safe and effective.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe health sector is at the core of Ghana\u2019s development. It is essential for the wellbeing of all Ghanaians that funding for health is prioritized. A healthy population is the basis for a prosperous population,\u201d said Ambassador Palmer at the launch event.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">The NHIA-USAID partnership aims to improve NHIA\u2019s capacity to digitalize all its information systems. Digitalization will make data available to NHIA to better communicate the Scheme\u2019s financial and programmatic status to stakeholders. The partnership will also focus on building NHIA systems to monitor clinical quality of health care services. This actionable clinical data will help NHIA advocate for improved quality of care across public, faith-based and private health care facilities contributing to improved health outcomes across Ghana.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">USAID\u2019s integrated health programming supports the Government of Ghana in the areas of health system strengthening, maternal, reproductive, newborn and child health, as well as malaria, HIV, social protection, water, sanitation and hygiene, global health security, and COVID-19.
