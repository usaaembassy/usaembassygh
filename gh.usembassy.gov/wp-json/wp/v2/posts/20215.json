Please stand so we can recognize you all.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I\u2019d also like to thank Joe Mensah, Felix Addo, and the other previous board members for their tremendous leadership during their time in office.\u00a0 Can that team please stand? We owe you a huge debt of gratitude for your <\/span><b>selfless dedication<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to AMCHAM\u2019s continuous development and success. Wayade3!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Some of you may know that I often include Ghanaian proverbs in my public remarks. Here is the one I chose for this evening: Tootoote tootoote, yerenom nsa na yerefa adwen.<\/span><b> <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Little by little, little by little, as we drink, we make plans, or, even in a seemingly light moment, we can gradually make progress on other more important issues.\u00a0 I hope that as we break bread with each other this evening, we can build on the positive momentum towards an ever-stronger U.S.-Ghana partnership.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The United States\u2019 highest foreign policy priority is to promote trade and investments by American companies around the world.\u00a0 As Ambassador, that is also my highest priority here in Ghana. We understand that 21<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">st<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> century economies are driven by dynamic private sectors that encourage creativity, innovation, and job creation. In this way, the private sector plays a leading role in generating prosperity for citizens. You, the members of AMCHAM, are our essential partners in this effort.\u00a0 Thank you for bringing to Ghana the quality and high reputation of American goods and brands, which have earned the trust and confidence of Ghanaian consumers. Thanksgiving is not only about sharing a special time with family and friends and enjoying turkey and trimmings. It is also about taking time to be thankful and mindful of the many blessings in our lives each day, both big and small, the challenges as well as the triumphs, and to remember that at the heart of this holiday stands the spirit of unity.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When we look back on AMCHAM\u2019s activities over this remarkable past year, and the road we\u2019ve traveled together, there are a lot of reasons to give thanks.\u00a0 In 2019, the Year of Return, we have welcomed several high-profile visitors, announced new office openings, signed MOU\u2019s, and celebrated promotions.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I previewed last week at the Annual General Meeting that I would cite several of this year\u2019s successes in my remarks at tonight\u2019s function.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Together, we welcomed distinguished guests like Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Civil Rights legend Congressman John Lewis, Chair of the House SubCommittee on Africa and Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Karen Bass, as part of a robust delegation that included 13 members of the CBC. We highlighted for them the great work that so many U.S. companies are doing here in Ghana.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Companies like \u201cDignity Do The Right Thing\u201d that are providing jobs, increasing trade, and prioritizing the wellbeing of their employees.\u00a0 DTRT is just one example of an AMCHAM member that is not only doing good business, but also being in the business of doing good.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Last month, AMCHAM also hosted Deputy Secretary of the Department of Agriculture Steve Censky during his first trip to West Africa.\u00a0 The Deputy Secretary brought with him companies from across the region and the United States to explore opportunities in Ghana\u2019s agriculture sector.\u00a0 In one week, this trade mission generated more than 450 business-to-business meetings, leading to at least nearly $12 million in projected sales of U.S. food and agricultural products over the next year.\u00a0 This is a testament to the growing interest that American businesswomen and men have in Ghana\u2019s market.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We have partnered with AMCHAM on receptions, lunches, and dinners, including to welcome Governor of Mississippi Phil Bryant, and the Regional Director for Sub-Saharan Africa at the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, Heather Lanigan. AMCHAM also signed an MOU to support the development of tomorrow\u2019s business leaders via the Young African Leaders Initiative, or YALI, Regional Leadership Center at GIMPA.\u00a0 Thank you for that \u2013 In fact, I attended Cohort 15\u2019s closing ceremony yesterday and was inspired by their energy and commitment to <\/span><b>service beyond self<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In addition, 2019 also brought new members to AMCHAM, companies like ExxonMobil, Procter and Gamble, and Bunge have joined the fold, adding to the growing family of companies who are changing Ghana\u2019s industries.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We are proud of how far AMCHAM has come.\u00a0 With over 100 members, accounting for greater investments and thousands of jobs, AMCHAM is stronger than ever.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Modeling <\/span><b>service above self<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, AMCHAM members are working to advocate for and offer feedback on the new Companies Act, in an effort to better align government policies and industry equities.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">AMCHAM members have been working with my team at the Embassy to engage with Ghanaian policy makers to help craft more comprehensive and nuanced industry regulations, trying to engage earlier in the stakeholder-consultation process.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We are also seeing AMCHAM members galvanize other chambers and groups on everything from sector-specific considerations to the overall business climate.My team and I are grateful for AMCHAM\u2019s potential to generate even more investments, to welcome even more new members, and to promote an even more conducive business environment here in Ghana.\u00a0 As part of the BUILD Act and Prosper Africa, the soon-to-be-launched U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, or DFC, will double OPIC\u2019s previous funding from $30 billion to $60 billion dollars, and make available more creative financing mechanisms.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As a result, businesses will have more opportunities to unlock investment potential in Ghana and across the region.\u00a0 The U.S. government has also established a new five-year trade and investment hub for West Africa to facilitate economic growth in strategic sectors, including agriculture, services, water and sanitation, and light manufacturing, by co-investing with the private sector and other organizations, such as research institutions. These types of initiatives are especially timely looking ahead to the establishment in Accra next year of the secretariat for the African Union\u2019s Continental Free Trade Area.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Moving forward, I\u2019m confident that together, we and AMCHAM will continue to build on the strong foundation we\u2019ve already established over three decades.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In closing, I offer my congratulations in advance to tonight\u2019s honorees and award recipients.\u00a0 I wish each and every one of you here tonight an enjoyable evening and a Happy Thanksgiving Day on Thursday, when Americans celebrate our own \u201chomowo\u201d festival.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Medaase!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ambassador Sullivan\u2019s Remarks AMCHAM Thanksgiving Dinner AMCHAM Ghana at 30P celebrating 30 Years of Promoting Trade and Investment Between Ghana and the United States Marriott Hotel, Accra Saturday, November 23, 2019;
