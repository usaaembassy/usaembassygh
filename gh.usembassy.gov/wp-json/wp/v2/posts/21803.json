Sullivan\u2019s Remarks \u2013 AS PREPARED<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>at the Academy of Women Entrepreneurs (AWE) Cohort Three<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Certificate Ceremony<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>GIMPA Executive Conference Center, <\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Thursday, July 29, 2021 10:00am-12:00pm<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Good morning!<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s great to be back here at GIMPA to recognize another cohort of AWE graduates.\u00a0 I want to thank Academy of Women Entrepreneurs Director Ms. Shola Safo-Duodo for her tireless and committed leadership \u00a0of this AWEsome program and for her inspired mentorship to women entrepreneurs, from which I\u2019m certain you have all benefitted.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s incredible to see how the Academy of Women Entrepreneurs has grown \u2013 from 30 women in the inaugural cohort, to 48 in cohort two, and now our strongest cohort yet of 100 AWEsome women.\u00a0 The expansion shows the demand for this type of training and is a testament to the success of its graduates.<\/p>\n<p>One of the top priorities of the U.S. government is the promotion of inclusive economic growth, and increasing trade and investment between the United States and countries in Africa. Entrepreneurs like you are central to that effort.<\/p>\n<p>We aim to support and develop entrepreneurs, because we know you can be powerful engines for economic growth and job creation.\u00a0 Women entrepreneurs have the drive, the talent, and the commitment to start and grow businesses, but often don\u2019t get the same opportunities or the same support that men receive.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s where AWE comes in \u2013 to break down barriers that are holding women back and make economies stronger for everyone. I want to highlight the success of two Cohort One AWE graduates who unlocked even more opportunity as recipients of U.S. African Development Foundation, ADF, grants.\u00a0 The first is Ms. Patience Owusu, owner of Peema Naturals, a shea butter hair and skin care products company.\u00a0 Patience started the company in her home, using a kitchen mixer.\u00a0 Thanks to AWE, she was eligible to compete for a ADF small grant that has allowed her to procure industrial-grade processing equipment, a delivery van, a large inventory of raw shea and other ingredients, and fund production safety and quality control training for her and the new staff she\u2019s been able to hire.\u00a0 Now she has an eye on export opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>The second woman is none other than Ghana\u2019s Mushroom Queen, Fafape Ama Etsa Foe.\u00a0 Through AWE, she sharpened her marketing skills to promote mushrooms as a healthy and environmentally friendly alternative to meat and also received an ADF grant.\u00a0 Fafape is using her grant to train 60 mushroom cultivators on post-harvest processing to dry and preserve mushrooms.\u00a0 The ADF funds will also subsidize machines for vacuum packaging and labeling, and trainer fees on food safety and ideas for value-addition, such as kebabs, jerky, and mushroom seasoning.<\/p>\n<p>These are just two examples among many AWE graduates who have embraced the vision of \u201cAWE \u2013 Women Without Limits.\u201d\u00a0 I know that each of you will achieve success in your own right, and my team looks forward to hearing how you grow your business.\u00a0 We have seen the benefits multiply, as when women succeed, children are educated, and communities thrive.<\/p>\n<p>You should feel proud of your accomplishment in completing this course amidst all the competing demands on your time and energy.\u00a0 \u00a0Truly, our resilience has been tested since the onset of the pandemic nearly one and a half years ago, and we continue to have to adapt to the new reality to keep ourselves, our families, and our communities safe.\u00a0 The United States is taking a leading role in the global pandemic response through our return to the World Health Organization, our support to the COVAX Facility, and our provision of vaccines bilaterally to Ghana and other countries via COVAX and the African Union.\u00a0 \u00a0As President Akufo-Addo mentioned in his July 25 address to the nation, 1,229,670 million doses of US-provided Pfizer vaccine will arrive in Ghana soon.<\/p>\n<p>The United States continues to collaborate with partners, government, and the private sector to meet healthcare needs and economic concerns.\u00a0 As entrepreneurs, and frankly, as women, you\u2019re already familiar with juggling multiple complex challenges simultaneously.\u00a0 Our hope is that AWE has strengthened your resolve and support network so that even in the face of adversity, you\u2019re able to seize opportunities that emerge.<\/p>\n<p>Examples of this include AWE alumnae, women entrepreneurs like you, who seized the moment and quickly adapted their business skills to different industries when the pandemic hit.\u00a0 One woman, who realized that fashion was not going to be as a high priority during lockdown, pivoted to working in the more essential grain production and supply, meeting a critical food security demand for staples when borders were closed.\u00a0 Another woman, who owns an interior design business, quickly seized upon the opportunity to attract clients by adapting their homes to provide telework spaces.<\/p>\n<p>Yet another, a fitness guru, moved her coaching to an online platform when she couldn\u2019t lead trainings in person. She now has a global clientele! The pandemic won\u2019t be the last time you are tested as entrepreneurs, and you\u2019ll draw on the skills and knowledge \u2013 and networks \u2013 you&#8217;ve gained from AWE to meet evolving demands for the rest of your careers.<\/p>\n<p>Secretary Blinken has commented that \u201centrepreneurs have a critical role to play in building dynamic, innovative economies that create opportunities for people.\u201d\u00a0 That means jobs for the teeming youth population. Our U.S. mission goals include promoting such opportunity through programs like AWE, because your increased economic opportunities increase Ghana\u2019s overall economic success.<\/p>\n<p>Your success is Ghana\u2019s success, and we are proud to support you to become Ghana\u2019s next cohort of dynamic entrepreneurs, business leaders, and economic influencers. I&#8217;m delighted to celebrate with you today your momentous achievements so far. It doesn\u2019t end here\u2026 I trust the certificate you receive today symbolizing your new skills and renewed determination to succeed, will inspire you to greater heights.<\/p>\n<p>Congratulations, AWE Cohort Three graduates!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ambassador Stephanie S.
