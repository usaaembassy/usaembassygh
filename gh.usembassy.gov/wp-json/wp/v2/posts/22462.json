Sullivan.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to Coastal West Africa, the U.S. Strategy includes Haiti, Libya, Mozambique, and Papua New Guinea as priority countries.\u00a0 Each collaboration presents a unique opportunity to leverage lessons learned, enhance U.S. government engagement with partners and jointly build resilience against political, economic, and natural shocks.\u00a0 Work under the Strategy in Coastal West Africa will complement the U.S. government\u2019s continued commitment to peace and prosperity in the Sahel, and also leverage the longstanding U.S. government partnership with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).<\/p>\n<p>The Strategy utilizes diplomacy as well as development, and security-sector cooperation and assistance to achieve joint outcomes.\u00a0 It seeks to address local challenges in more effective ways through flexibility; in-depth analysis; robust consultations involving local, national, and regional partners; and working together with international and development organizations.<\/p>\n<p>For more information on the U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability, please visit <a href=\"https:\/\/www.state.gov\/stability-strategy\/\">https:\/\/www.state.gov\/stability-strategy.<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">###<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Accra, Ghana \u2013 On Friday, the U.S. government announced its intent to partner with five Coastal West African countries (Benin, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, and Togo) in the context of the ten-year U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability.\u00a0 In response to common issues raised in each of the five countries, this Strategy enables &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1058,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_gpalab_slo_mission_select":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[4,44,61],"tags":[10016],"class_list":["post-22462","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-ambassador","category-press-releases","category-us-and-gh","tag-security-cooperation"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) -
