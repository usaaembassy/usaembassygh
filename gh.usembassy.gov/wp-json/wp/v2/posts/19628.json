I am very glad to participate in my first Steering Committee Meeting.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m also happy to welcome my colleagues from the United States: Ambassador Michael Arietti, who is leading the U.S. delegation to Accra this week, and representatives of the various agencies representing SGI\u2019s focus areas.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s been just over three years since we signed the Joint Country Action Plan.\u00a0 In that document, we set out goals to enhance the capacity of Ghana\u2019s institutions to safeguard the nation\u2019s maritime domain, borders, and cyberspace; and to strengthen the justice institutions so vital to a secure and vibrant democracy.<\/p>\n<p>The goal of these reforms has always been to promote security <em>and<\/em> to enable the conditions for building national prosperity.\u00a0 Let me emphasize &#8211; Ghana stands to gain enormously from these reforms:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the maritime area, effective measures against illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing; piracy; oil bunkering; and pollution will make possible a sustainable fishing industry, a thriving and secure oil and gas sector, increased port revenues, and coastal tourism;<\/li>\n<li>On border security, effective border management will increase trade and customs revenue by ensuring the safe and efficient movement of goods and people, while countering the illegal actors and activities that undermine prosperity;<\/li>\n<li>In cybercrime and cybersecurity, promoting best practices and developing effective defenses will facilitate a thriving digital economy, and enhance Ghana\u2019s \u201cdoing business\u201d standing;<\/li>\n<li>And in the justice sector, improved efficiency, transparency, and fairness, are essential to effective governance underpinning all of these areas.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Let me assure all of you here today: \u00a0SGI reforms are strategic reforms: mutually reinforcing, and mutually beneficial to both our countries. That is why the United States continues to stand firm in its commitment to support Ghana in making them.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve made significant progress since the last meeting in September 2018.\u00a0 At that meeting, we outlined a plan to transition from the \u201cdesign\u201d phase of the JCAP to the \u201cimplementation\u201d phase.\u00a0 And in several areas, we have made just that kind of progress.<\/p>\n<p>I congratulate you for your achievements since then.\u00a0 Let us all acknowledge the skills and hard work the members of the technical working groups have demonstrated and the political support from leadership that was necessary to get us to this point.\u00a0 Ayikoo!<\/p>\n<p>My question to you now is: Can we continue to make progress to the point where we start to see real changes on the ground?<\/p>\n<p>I firmly believe that the key to building on these successes is sustaining and, most importantly, institutionalizing the interagency relationships and muscle memory for coordination you\u2019ve developed over the past three years.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, in the JCAP, we identified one of the principal means of achieving our goals:\u00a0 by building whole-of-government institutions that are <em>empowered<\/em> to effectively share and act on information to safeguard the nation.\u00a0 This idea\u2014that information is power\u2014is one I want to emphasize.<\/p>\n<p>What does it mean, that information is power? \u00a0It doesn\u2019t mean that those who have a monopoly on information have great power.\u00a0 In fact, information is power only when shared, and shared appropriately\u2014in other words, with the right people and at the right time.<\/p>\n<p>There is a Ghanaian proverb that says, \u201cTi koro nko agyina\u201d or \u201cOne head does not hold counsel,\u201d that I think illustrates this idea nicely.\u00a0 One agency, acting alone and without counsel, may act in the wrong way, or too late, or not at all.<\/p>\n<p>I cannot stress enough how important this concept has been in our own efforts to counter the threats <em>we<\/em> face.\u00a0 After the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, D.C. on September 11, 2001, the United States made effective use of information the centerpiece of our security strategy. \u00a0As director of the State Department\u2019s Operations Center, I made sure my team understood how to collaborate with other agencies to share and act on information.<\/p>\n<p>Exchanging information isn\u2019t difficult\u2014it isn\u2019t hard to set up meetings, exchange phone calls, and reports. \u00a0What is hard is putting information to <em>use<\/em>\u2014acting on information in a coordinated way with the right people and at the right time.\u00a0 Doing this requires a keen understanding of how interagency colleagues operate, including who needs to know, what actions they can take to respond, or even better, providing actionable information in order to make the save before it\u2019s too late.<\/p>\n<p>SGI\u2019s support for increased collaboration in Ghana\u2019s strategic planning is one of its major accomplishments to date.\u00a0 Going forward, collaboration on the implementation of these strategies will be critical for success.<\/p>\n<p>We will see changes on the ground when implementation of a maritime strategy facilitates the effective interdiction of crimes at sea;<\/p>\n<p>when border security committees are meeting regularly to plan and participate in patrols, operations, and community engagement;<\/p>\n<p>when the national Computer Emergency Response Team successfully prevents or coordinates recovery from a cyberattack;<\/p>\n<p>and when the data you collect from the Case Tracking System helps you improve Ghana\u2019s capacity to effectively investigate and prosecute crimes.\u00a0 This will also strengthen the deterrent element of national security.<\/p>\n<p>We will see changes on the ground when the reforms you\u2019re implementing institutionalize cooperation on putting information to use. \u00a0Strong democratic institutions embody these concepts by using timely information to act in the interests of the citizens they serve.<\/p>\n<p>I therefore urge the Steering Committee to continue their support for building these institutions, even, or especially, when doing so means changes to the status quo.\u00a0 The United States stands ready to support you in this transformative journey.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for your time and attention. \u00a0I wish you great success in continuing to implement the reforms we all seek to achieve between now and the next SGI Steering Committee Meeting.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Accra, Ghana \u2013 On Thursday, May 9, 2019, senior representatives from the governments of the United States and Ghana participated in the 5th Security Governance Initiative (SGI) Steering Committee Meeting at the West Africa Regional Training Center in Accra.\u00a0 The event was attended by U.S. Ambassador to Ghana Stephanie S.
