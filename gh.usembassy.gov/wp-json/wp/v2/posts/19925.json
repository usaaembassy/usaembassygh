Chief of Defense Staff of the Ghana Armed Forces, Lt. General Obed Akwah<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Hon. Chief of Staff of U.S. Africa Command, Major General Todd McCaffrey <\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Honorable Service Chiefs of the Ghana Armed Forces<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Distinguished Guests and Visitors,<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m delighted to be here this morning, together with so many civilian and military security professionals from more than 40 countries, who have gathered in Ghana to discuss our shared, mutual interests in the broad field of military communications.<\/p>\n<p>United States Africa Command (or AFRICOM) and the Ghana Armed Forces have gone to great lengths to assemble world-class speakers and participants, each of whom brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise from their home countries.\u00a0 It is therefore particularly appropriate, as you discuss communications interoperability, that you give and take the best ideas everyone in the room has to offer.<\/p>\n<p>This conference will cover quite a number of topics, including two that are of particular importance for the United States and Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>The first is the crucial role of women in advancing and solidifying international peace and security\u2026 a topic that is particularly appropriate as we celebrate the 60<sup>th<\/sup> anniversary of women serving in the Ghana Armed Forces.\u00a0 We often talk about the importance of fostering women\u2019s political engagement and economic empowerment, and certainly those are critical underpinnings for the future success and development of any society.\u00a0 But women who serve in, or oversee, their countries\u2019 security services play a uniquely important role.\u00a0 During yesterday\u2019s \u201cWomen\u2019s Signal Forum,\u201d 27 women from 26 countries deliberated and shared best practices on creating gender balance in peace and security decision-making. We recognize Ghana\u2019s leadership in this area, and I encourage all of you to keep this critical conversation going well after you have returned home.<\/p>\n<p>The second topic that is very much in line with U.S. priorities \u2013 not just in Ghana, but globally \u2013 is cybersecurity, including our common objective of an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable cyberspace.\u00a0 Here in Ghana, we collaborate closely with the government, through the Security Governance Initiative, to promote best practices in cyber security\u2026 both the security of cyber platforms themselves, and mitigating the possibility that cyberspace could be exploited for criminal or other nefarious purposes.<\/p>\n<p>I know that we have with us in the room today a number of leaders in this field who are well-positioned to advance our global efforts to promote cybersecurity best practices.\u00a0 Alongside those experts are undoubtedly others (such as myself) who may not be expert in these technologies but who are nonetheless dedicated to striking the right balance between a fully accessible Internet that facilitates information-sharing, trade and commerce, and one that includes protections to mitigate against dangerous vulnerabilities and threats.<\/p>\n<p>Every technological advancement in history has presented new opportunities and challenges, and the Internet is no exception.\u00a0 Cyber-enabled threats have proliferated as our systems have become more and more interconnected.\u00a0 These threats range from state-sponsored attempts to target major critical infrastructure to the use of ransomware by cybercriminals to extort a single individual or hold hostage sensitive information.<\/p>\n<p>So how do we deal with these growing threats to our networks and infrastructure?<\/p>\n<p>Addressing this question will be a key part of what you discuss over the coming days.\u00a0 What best practices have some countries or security services adopted that might be applicable somewhere else?\u00a0 How can National Cyber Strategies and whole-of-government approaches increase awareness, education and training?\u00a0 What opportunities might exist for public-private partnerships?\u00a0 How do we most effectively share information across borders to ensure that no country becomes a safe haven for malicious cyber activity?<\/p>\n<p>You may not find the answers to all of these questions in the coming days, and of course there\u2019s no \u201cone size fits all\u201d solution.\u00a0 National Cyber Strategies must be tailored to each nation\u2019s own realities, aspirations, and goals. \u00a0But in developing those strategies, all governments benefit from seeking input from the private sector and civil society.\u00a0 This includes educating citizens and industry representatives about their own important roles in protecting cyber systems.\u00a0 We must foster cybersecurity talent, as a highly-skilled cadre of cybersecurity experts is a strategic national security advantage. \u00a0And we should listen to, and learn from, each other on how best to develop this expertise. \u00a0Only by taking this sort of methodical approach will we be able to articulate our objectives, define our priorities, and allocate resources to address our respective nations\u2019 cyber concerns.<\/p>\n<p>The work of each of you in this room, and the organizations you represent, is fundamental to this effort. \u00a0Our relationships and partnerships are key to mitigating threats and defending our countries and citizens against cyber threats.<\/p>\n<p>I hope that this conference will create space for open and fruitful conversation.\u00a0 As you move forward in your work, know you can count on the continued support of the United States.\u00a0 Thank you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Africa Endeavor 2019 Opening Remarks by\u00a0 Charg\u00e9 d&#8217;Affaires Christopher J.
