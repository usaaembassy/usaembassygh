delivery<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Honorable Minister of Finance Ken Ofori-Atta<br \/>\nHonorable Minister for Lands and Natural Resources Samuel Abdulai Jinapor<br \/>\nHonorable Deputy Minister for Defence Kofi Amankwah-Manu<br \/>\nChief of Defence Staff Vice Admiral Seth Amoama<br \/>\nChief of Army Staff Major General Thomas Oppong-Peprah<br \/>\nChief of Air Staff Air Vice Marshall Frederick Asare Bekoe<br \/>\nChief of Naval Staff\u00a0 Rear Admiral Issah Yakubu<br \/>\nSenior officials, fellow diplomats and friends<\/p>\n<p>As part of these protocols and because this is a military celebration, please allow me, Admiral Amoama, to, through you, celebrate the incredibly important role of the Ghana Armed Forces \u2013 you are terrific partners for the American military, brilliant peacekeepers, and a model of a professional military subordinate to civilian rule, something ever more important as we see democratic backsliding all around the region.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re honored to have so many Ghanaian leaders with us tonight to celebrate the 248<sup>th<\/sup> birthday of the U.S. Marine Corps \u2013 yes the Marine Corps is older than the United States!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I love that we\u2019re all dressed up to celebrate \u2013 and you\u2019re looking GOOD \u2013 but I think it\u2019s important to appreciate that over the years \u2013 and even today, Marines have gathered in dreadful\u2026 and dangerous conditions, not in fancy ballrooms but on the sides of muddy hills, sometimes under enemy fire, to celebrate this birthday.<\/p>\n<p>Last year I told a lot of jokes about how tough the Marines are, likening them to \u201crotweilers or Dobermans \u2013 big and mean or skinny and mean\u201d (many a truth in jest!).\u00a0 But since our celebration this year falls on the anniversary of Armistice Day, the end of \u201cwar to end all wars\u201d but fighting still rages in Ukraine and the Middle East, I want to be more serious.\u00a0 As we pray for peace and an end to the suffering of innocent civilians, I want to talk a little about how Marines are warriors not killers.\u00a0 Arguably the most elite of the most elite fighting force the world has ever known, the Marines are a force that seeks to maintain peace and ensure security through deterrence, peacekeeping operations, or if necessary armed conflict, capable of wielding deadly violence but violence intended not for conquest but to restore peace.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to shine a light on our Marine Security Guard detachment.\u00a0 Fewer than 1% of Marines are chosen for this duty.\u00a0 2023 marks the 75<sup>th<\/sup> anniversary of the Marine Security Guard program. \u00a0\u00a0This past August we marked the 25<sup>th<\/sup> anniversary of the bombings of our Embassies in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi. \u00a0This month marks the 44<sup>th<\/sup> anniversary of the attack on the American Embassy in Islamabad where a Marine Security guard lost his life.\u00a0 In December it will be 19 years since our Consulate in Jeddah was attacked. \u00a0It has been a short two years since the evacuation from Afghanistan. \u00a0In each of these, Marines Security Guards ran towards the danger while helping others out of it.<\/p>\n<p>Our Marine Security Guard Detachment here at US Embassy Accra are our \u201cAmbassadors in Blue.\u201d \u00a0And they personify one of the United States\u2019 greatest strengths \u2013 diversity and using the unique talents of each individual. \u00a0They hail from New Jersey, Florida, Texas, California, and Missouri. \u00a0While they are diverse in their backgrounds, they are united as Marines. \u00a0E pluribus Unum \u2013 out of many, one. \u00a0Please join me in recognizing<\/p>\n<p>Gunnery Sergeant Michael Elias<br \/>\nSergeant Robert Rodriguez<br \/>\nSergeant Alejandro Estrada<br \/>\nSergeant Mark Taboada<br \/>\nSergeant Luke Spadafora<br \/>\nLance Corporal Jorge Salas<br \/>\nLance Corporal Nicholas Velazquez<br \/>\nPrivate First Class Blake Chandler<\/p>\n<p>And I am proud to announce that three of our eight-member detachment were recently selected for promotion.\u00a0 Congratulations to Sergeant Rodriguez, Sergeant Estrada, and Sergeant Spadafora!<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d also like to add a personal note about our Guest of Honor tonight.\u00a0 Lt Col Vic Maduka.\u00a0 Vic is of Nigerian heritage, so he takes some grief from me because he doesn\u2019t know good jollof\u2013 but he\u2019s an outstanding Defense Attache and Marine aviator.\u00a0 I trust his judgment and have relied on his counsel.\u00a0 Vic, you represent the best of the Marine Corps.<\/p>\n<p>We celebrate all of you who have earned the right to wear the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor. \u00a0As President Ronald Reagan once said, \u201cSome people wonder all their lives if they\u2019ve made a difference. \u00a0The Marines don\u2019t have that problem.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSemper Fi\u201d and Happy Birthday Marines!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ambassador Palmer Remarks at the Marine Ball November 11, 2023 As
