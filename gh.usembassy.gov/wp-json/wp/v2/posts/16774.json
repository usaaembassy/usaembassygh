Through President Obama\u2019s Young African Leaders Initiative, the United States is investing in the next generation of African leaders, and has committed significant resources to enhance leadership skills, bolster entrepreneurship, and connect young African leaders with one another, the United States, and the American people.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ve had the pleasure of meeting several Mandela Fellows, and I can attest to the fact that these are individuals who inspire the same values that both the NBA and the US cherish.<\/p>\n<p>As Ambassador I welcome all of you to Ghana.\u00a0 I thank you for your efforts to nurture that dream, and inspire those you encounter in your clinics to be persistent and not give up. It\u2019s an important lesson for all of us, but I know the time that the Ghanaian youth get to spend with you on the court today will be moments they treasure for the rest of their lives.<\/p>\n<p>The NBA professionals\u2019 willingness to serve as role models and mentors are important efforts that build bridges and partnerships from the United States to Africa. We recognize when the private sector partners to enhance youth engagement and opportunity, the outcome magnifies.\u00a0 We\u2019ve appreciated Coca-cola\u2019s partnership in the past year on a number of occasions and welcome you to the embassy as well.\u00a0 \u00a0We look forward to watching your continued individual successes, this teams\u2019 success and to watching the Ghanaian NBA fan base continue to grow.<\/p>\n<p>I now welcome Yaw Sakyi\u00a0 (procounced SACHI) Afari, coordinator of this week\u2019s events to offer a few remarks.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning colleagues and Embassy community, It\u2019s great to see all of you turn up this morning to take advantage of the rare opportunity to meet NBA management and players.
