My heartfelt congratulations go to AWMA and the School of Information and Communication Studies of the University of Ghana for completing this body of work, especially during a pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. Embassy is honored to have sponsored the creation and dissemination of this timely report. Equality, inclusion, and representation of diversity \u2013 including of women \u2013 in every facet of our society, including the media, are critical and important goals.<\/p>\n<p>Whether print, broadcast, or digital, the power that media hold in shaping society is massive.\u00a0 In short, media act as a mirror, reflecting society as it is and what it can be. This is why representation of women matters. The \u201cStatus of Women in the Ghanaian Media\u201d report checks the image in the mirror and recommends steps and policies to improve the situation where necessary.<\/p>\n<p>This report establishes a baseline for evidence-based advocacy efforts, from making a concerted effort to recruit and retain women in the newsroom at all levels &#8212; from intern to owner \u2013 to providing training to detect and avoid gender bias in reporting.<\/p>\n<p>The issues of gender balance and bias in the newsroom and in reporting are not unique to Ghana.\u00a0 We continue to grapple with the same issues in the United States.\u00a0 A report by the U.S. nonprofit Women\u2019s Media Center entitled \u201cThe Status of Women in the U.S. Media 2019\u201d showed that, despite some gains, men still make up the majority of personnel at every level in news, entertainment, and digital media.\u00a0Women, the same study showed, make up only 42% of the overall newsroom workforce.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. Embassy recognizes the important role that free and responsible media play in shaping and maintaining a democracy, and we believe women should be in the forefront \u2026both at the keyboard and in the story itself. Last year, we brought U.S. journalist and international trainer Sarah Wachter to Ghana to speak on this topic.\u00a0 In fact, many of you heard her speak at AWMA\u2019s first anniversary event about the importance of gender parity in the newsroom and combatting gender bias in reporting.\u00a0 She spoke about how major newspapers and networks are being intentional towards attaining better gender balance.\u00a0 We see BBC News programs enforcing a 50 percent rule on coverage and sourcing and the <em>New York Times<\/em> going back in time to feature obituaries of famous women the newspaper had overlooked.<\/p>\n<p>But we still have work to do.\u00a0Especially in the immediate term, with the upcoming election season. Ghana has a solid line of women in high political positions such as the current Foreign Minister, the Minister for Communications, the President\u2019s Chief of Staff, and the former Chief Justice.<\/p>\n<p>2020 presents an awesome opportunity for media practitioners, both male and female, to demonstrate how to treat women politicians respectfully and appropriately \u2013 holding them just as accountable as their male counterparts, while focusing on the substance of their candidacies rather than treating them differently because they are women.\u00a0 All candidates should be respected for what they bring to the table, rather than what they wear to it!<\/p>\n<p>As media practitioners, you have a critical role to play in avoiding and countering narratives that reinforce gender stereotypes. And when convening spirited yet civil political debates, I trust media houses will say no to the \u201cmanel,\u201da panel that features only men, and include women subject matter experts.<\/p>\n<p>In Ghana, women make up more than half of the population and are found in every sector, leaving little justification for manels. Ayekoo once again, to AWMA and the School of Information and Communication Studies of the University of Ghana for producing this significant work.\u00a0 I look forward to the report\u2019s dissemination, as well as to the consciousness raising, advocacy, and policy development to follow.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Alliance of Women in Media in Africa (AWMA) \u201cStatus of Women in the Ghanaian Media\u201d Report Launch Remarks by Ambassador Stephanie S.
