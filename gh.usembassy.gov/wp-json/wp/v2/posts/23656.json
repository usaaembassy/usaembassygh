These include improving quality service delivery in health, basic education, agriculture, and fisheries,\u201d said Rosen at the launch event.<\/p>\n<p>The USAID Political Accountability Activity is being implemented by the Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening (CEPPS), which includes the International Republican Institute (IRI), the National Democratic Institute (NDI) and the International Federation for Electoral Systems (IFES).<\/p>\n<p>The project will also address issues of electoral reforms, deepen political decentralization, promote inclusive governance, and support the development of peaceful norms as important factors to strengthen accountability in Ghana\u2019s political system. The project will include collaboration with independent agencies of government and civil society to strengthen campaign finance rules and prevent electoral violence.\u00a0 These efforts will aim to assist political parties and the Electoral Commission to monitor compliance with electoral laws as well as promote peaceful and tolerant political norms.<\/p>\n<p>###<\/p>\n<p><strong>About USAID<\/strong><br \/>\nThe United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is the lead U.S. Government agency that works to end extreme global poverty and enable resilient, democratic societies to realize their potential.\u00a0 USAID&#8217;s activities and strategic partnerships support Ghana&#8217;s journey to self-reliance.
