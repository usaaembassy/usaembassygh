Prison overcrowding is a major financial, human rights, and administrative problem many nations face, including the United States.\u00a0 Many correctional facilities worldwide operate beyond maximum capacity, which endangers prisoners\u2019 health and lives, and potentially puts prison staff at risk as well.<\/p>\n<p>Overcrowding has many causes, but these can be addressed without necessarily building more prisons. \u00a0Strengthening the capacity of the justice system for speedy trials, providing defense counsels, introducing alternatives to incarceration in Ghana\u2019s criminal code, \u2013 such as community service \u2013 and modernizing case tracking are among the initiatives that have proven effective.<\/p>\n<p>Over the years, the United States has provided support for prison reform along these lines in Ghana.\u00a0 In 2017-2018, we trained magistrates and district court judges on prioritizing bail decisions so that individuals who are not violent and pose minimal flight risk are not detained while awaiting trial.\u00a0 Today we witnessed the dedication of judicial officials and the joy of some who received bail.<\/p>\n<p>In 2018, the U.S. Government funded the In-Prison Paralegal Program, in Nsawam Prison in the Eastern Region. \u00a0The project trained inmates and prison officers to help write and file appeals for inmates who opt to represent themselves in court. \u00a0With the support of Her Ladyship Chief Justice Akuffo, we are working with the Office of the Attorney General and Ministry of Justice to develop draft plea agreement legislation. \u00a0This will help reduce court dockets by enabling cases to be settled by defense attorneys and prosecutors, which allows the courts to focus on the cases that require a trial.\u00a0 More than 90% of U.S. criminal cases are adjudicated with pleas, resulting in smaller remand populations, lighter court dockets, and speedier trials. \u00a0The same is possible here.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, we are helping to modernize existing case management methods in the legal system by developing an electronic Case Tracking System.\u00a0 This platform enables real-time visibility of criminal cases from arrest to sentencing, and addresses gaps in communication between key stakeholder agencies in the justice sector.\u00a0 Ho was one of the first test locations, and implementation continues.<\/p>\n<p>In closing, I\u2019d like to thank the Her Ladyship, the Chief Justice, for the opportunity to join her today.\u00a0 I commend your efforts in enabling much-needed reform in the justice sector. \u00a0I\u2019d also like to thank the POS Foundation for its dedication to the \u201cJustice for All Program\u201d and other initiatives towards prison decongestion and strengthening Ghana\u2019s justice sector.\u00a0 I look forward to our further collaboration ahead.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ambassador Sullivan\u2019s Remarks at the Visit of Ho Central Prison Friday, November 29, 2019;
