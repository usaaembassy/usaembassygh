We&#8217;ve talked today about pursuing your passion, finding your purpose, doing your best at what you love, and not worrying about meeting others&#8217; expectations for success. But with your friends sending you snaps, your favorite celebrities Instagramming their lives and all manner of news traveling like wildfire through WhatsApp, it can be hard to focus.\u00a0 These constant distractions are certainly increasing your capacity to multi-task, and there is no doubt that this skill is increasingly important in today&#8217;s world.<\/p>\n<p>That said, to really get good at something \u2014 anything \u2014 requires focus.\u00a0 Concert pianists practice five or six hours a day; that demand hasn&#8217;t changed with the advent of vlogging and stories. So the next time you read a book, just read the book.\u00a0 The next time you listen to a song, just listen to the song.\u00a0 You&#8217;ll be amazed how much more you appreciate the simple pleasures of life when you resist the temptation \u2014 every once in a while \u2014 to do five things at once.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, I would like to close with this thought:\u00a0 as graduates of an American university in Ghana, whose faculty and students come from literally the four corners of the globe, you are uniquely qualified to make a difference in this world.\u00a0 In a globalized world, no-one has the luxury anymore of being insular or insulated; metaphorically, the world is shrinking as we become increasingly interconnected.\u00a0 This is one of the great benefits of social media tools: to build and foster connections and thus break down fears and prejudices.<\/p>\n<p>A graduating senior from the International School of Kenya once called his six years at the school a &#8220;destructive experience \u2026 destructive to ignorance, racism and parochialism.&#8221;\u00a0 How?\u00a0 Many students in the U.S. choose to participate in Model United Nations as one of their extracurricular activities.\u00a0 But your whole education here has been a Model UN.\u00a0 Over the course of your time at Webster, how many nationalities were represented by your teachers and peers?\u00a0 How may religions?\u00a0 How many languages have you heard spoken, even learning a few phrases yourself?\u00a0 These experiences have opened your minds and hearts.\u00a0 You have embraced tolerance \u2014 that consummate Ghanaian value \u2014 you have lived it.\u00a0 You will embody it for as long as you live.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, your experiences in this university, wherever you go next, whether you realize it or not, make you cultural ambassadors.\u00a0 You may be a Ghanaian representing his or her culture and values while studying in the U.S., or explaining American culture and values to other Ghanaians who were not lucky enough to have had your experiences studying here in such a multicultural environment.\u00a0 Or maybe you are an American who can demystify sub-Saharan Africa to other Westerners.\u00a0 Or a student from a third country who can bear witness to the culture of tolerance that makes Ghana such a special place to live and grow up.<\/p>\n<p>Wherever you are coming from, and wherever you are going, as a result of your unique experiences here, you will be natural leaders in this age of globalization.<\/p>\n<p>So I congratulate you, graduating class of 2018, for all you have accomplished.\u00a0 I wish you the best of luck on your journey.\u00a0 This may seem like an ending, but in truth, it is only your beginning.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>During a commencement ceremony held at Webster University\u2019s campus in Accra on May 19, Ambassador Jackson congratulated the graduating class of 2018 and exhorted them to seek careers which fulfil a purpose in their lives: \u201cPurpose is an essential element of you.\u00a0 It is the reason you are on the planet at this particular time &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1058,"featured_media":18745,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_gpalab_slo_mission_select":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[4,19,37],"tags":[5884,5882,5880,5886],"class_list":["post-18747","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-ambassador","category-education","category-news","tag-us-ambassador","tag-us-embassy-ghana","tag-webster-university-ghana","tag-webster-university-graduation"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) -
