Members of Parliament,<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Your Excellencies and Dear Colleagues from the Diplomatic Corps,<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Chairperson of

400\">Good evening. \u00a0Babs and I are delighted to welcome all of you here tonight to recognize an extraordinary woman who I feel fortunate to call a partner in the quest to safeguard Ghana\u2019s democracy. \u00a0The United States has a long tradition of recognizing women who have advocated for peace and democracy at great personal risk. \u00a0These women include Josephine Obiajulu Odumakin<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">from Nigeria, who was arrested 17 times for her involvement in more than 2,000 cases to protect the rights of women and children, and Henriette Ekwe Ebongo<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, a Cameroonian journalist who fought for freedom of the press during the years of one-party rule in the 1980s. \u00a0Like these women, Charlotte Osei epitomizes the phrase \u201cWoman of Courage,\u201d and I am honored to recognize her today on behalf of the U.S. Government. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ms. Osei rose to international prominence when she was named first female Chair of the Electoral Commission of Ghana. \u00a0But throughout her life, she has made a name for herself as a trailblazing woman and defender of democracy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">She began her career as a lawyer and law professor, emerging as one of Ghana\u2019s leading minds on constitutional law. \u00a0She was subsequently appointed as Chairperson of the National Commission for Civic Education (NCCE). \u00a0She used this post to promote civic engagement and elevate democratic discourse. \u00a0She launched an official website, increased communication with citizens, and initiated new programs to raise awareness and ignite debates, including Citizenship Week, the Dialogue Series, and the Democracy Lectures. \u00a0These events educated the populace and got Ghanaians across the political spectrum excited about the democratic process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But of course, Ms. Osei is best known for overseeing the 2016 Presidential and Parliamentary Elections\u2014the seventh consecutive democratic elections in Ghana, which set the stage for the third consecutive peaceful transition of power between political parties, since Ghana became a democracy in 1992. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Overseeing the logistics of this election was a daunting task and the stakes could not have been higher. \u00a0As the Chairperson of the Electoral Commission, Ms. Osei held the country\u2019s future in her hands because, in the words of American politician and reformer Al Smith, \u201cIt\u2019s not the voting that\u2019s democracy, it\u2019s the counting.\u201d \u00a0Before, during, and after the 2016 election, she faced a tremendous amount of scrutiny, under which many would have buckled. \u00a0And not all of the criticism was constructive or about the political process \u2014 she faced a number of personal, base, and inappropriate attacks. \u00a0But regardless, she persisted, using her conscience, her expertise in Ghanaian law, and her determination to uphold a democratic and fair process as her guide.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Under her leadership, the Electoral Commission undertook tough but necessary reforms, meticulously trained each and every electoral official and polling agent, and enforced electoral laws, regardless of any backlash. \u00a0She endured threats to her safety and that of her family for her strong stances, but she stood her ground, and undoubtedly raised the bar for what it takes to abide by the law. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">She ensured the Electoral Commission was open to change, and she employed strategic partnerships to great effect. \u00a0She leveraged support from the African Union, ECOWAS, the United States, United Nations, and the European Union among others to deploy election observers to polling stations throughout the country. \u00a0She partnered with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to develop and launch a new communication strategy to increase the flow of information to voters and boost the transparency of the Commission\u2019s work. \u00a0And she coordinated with various bilateral and multilateral development partners including the United Nations Development Program and the European Union, as well as Ghanaian civil society organizations, uniting a wide range of stakeholders behind a free, fair election that reinforced Ghana\u2019s proud democratic legacy. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Throughout her career, she has prioritized the active participation of vulnerable citizens. \u00a0Under her leadership, both the NCCE and the Electoral Commission trained hundreds of women\u2019s groups to get out the vote, and expanded efforts to address the needs of people with disabilities by working with the Ghana Federation of Disability Organizations to conduct disability access training across Ghana. \u00a0Thanks to this partnership, during the 2016 election, all 29,000 polling stations were equipped with Braille ballots so that visually impaired Ghanaians could vote independently. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ms. Osei received high praise for her management of the elections from international observers. \u00a0The 2016 elections solidified Ghana\u2019s status as a democratic role model for Africa, and indeed, for the entire world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But there is much work ahead. \u00a0Democracy is not something we tend to once every four years. \u00a0It never outgrows the need for active, engaged citizens and leaders who insist on fairness and due process over political expedience. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Electoral Commission and its leadership will continue to face challenges, criticism and scrutiny. \u00a0The vigorous debates that exist in Ghana are testament to the strength of this country\u2019s democracy. \u00a0As the Supreme Court\u2019s investigation of the accusations about impropriety at the Commission reminds us, democracy is messy and noisy. \u00a0However, when every single Ghanaian can feel safe in their ability to criticize their government \u2014 and to criticize those criticisms, the entire country is better off. \u00a0The key is to harness criticism as motivation to do better, while not allowing it to distract you from doing your job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While we are presenting this award to Charlotte Osei, I know there are many Ghanaian women who have taken a stand for strengthening democracy. \u00a0They too are heroes because they exemplify the highest commitment to advance the spirit of democracy for all Ghanaians, especially women and girls whose efforts are necessary to succeed in this critical journey.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I would like to close with a quote from another \u201cwoman of courage,\u201d the African American civil rights legend Rosa Parks. \u00a0She said, \u201cYou must never be fearful about what you are doing when it is right.\u201d \u00a0I urge everyone here to use these words as guidance. \u00a0I look forward to continuing to partner with you for a peaceful, inclusive, and democratic Ghana. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Honorable Ministers and Members of Parliament, Your Excellencies and Dear Colleagues from the Diplomatic Corps,
