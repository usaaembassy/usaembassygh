\u00a0It was a dirty double-crosser.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Perhaps I can share some trivia. \u00a0<\/span>What is a chicken\u2019s least favorite day of the week? \u00a0Fry-day<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">! \u00a0That\u2019s right; a little known fact. \u00a0And now I want to get serious. \u00a0Here is one more fun fact: \u00a0In 2016, Ghana was the second largest export market for U.S. poultry in Sub-Saharan Africa, which explains why the chicken crossed the ocean. \u00a0It is a relationship that we value greatly, and one that is mutually beneficial. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This event is unique for its seamless collaboration with the local poultry association, the Ghana National Association of Poultry Farmers. \u00a0The concept was instituted to lend support to the Ghanaian government\u2019s efforts to improve domestic poultry production. \u00a0Given the enormous potential for poultry production and consumption in Ghana, USAPEEC and the U.S. government believe that there is space for all within the Ghanaian poultry market. \u00a0As the poultry industry grows, and as agriculture develops, so too does our relationship through both capacity building and trade.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To help strengthen Ghana\u2019s poultry industry, the United States is funding two key projects under the Food for Progress program: \u00a0the Ghana Poultry Project and AMPLIFIES, which stands for Assisting Management in the Poultry and Layer Industries by Feed Improvement and Efficiency Strategies. \u00a0These projects are designed to improve the entrepreneurship of local Ghanaian producers throughout the full poultry value chain. \u00a0Together, they are valued at $56 million and are transforming the domestic poultry value chain \u2014 transformation that will both stimulate economic growth and contribute to food security.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Soon we\u2019ll know the name of this year\u2019s winner. \u00a0That student will be flown to the USA for a two-week culinary training course at the Institute of Culinary Education in New York City, courtesy of USAPEEC. \u00a0In addition to their poultry promotion efforts, USAPEEC deserves a round of applause for their support of continued education in Ghana. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In closing, I encourage everyone to of course eat more poultry and eggs, and to continue the good will and good work taking place to develop the Ghanaian poultry industry. \u00a0In doing so, we are strengthening our agricultural and business ties and bringing new life to the poultry industry while enhancing the lives of Ghanaian farmers, entrepreneurs, and consumers. \u00a0Thank you!<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Honorable Minister for Tourism, Culture and the Creative Arts, Mrs. Catherine Afeku, CEO of the Food and Drug Authority, Mrs Delese Mimi Darko, Executive Director of the Ghana Standards Authority, Professor Alex Dodoo, Colleagues, Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, Good evening and welcome to this year\u2019s USA Poultry and Egg Export Council \u2013 or USAPEEC &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1058,"featured_media":17285,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_gpalab_slo_mission_select":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[1163,4,37,54],"tags":[4032],"class_list":["post-17927","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-agriculture","category-ambassador","category-news","category-speeches","tag-usapeec"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>USA Poultry and Egg Export Council Gala Dinner Remarks by Ambassador Robert P.
