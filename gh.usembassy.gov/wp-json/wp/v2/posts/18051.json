Peace and prosperity are shared goals.\u00a0 You are the builders of a new Africa, a continent where innovation and youth leadership in all sectors is needed to promote vibrant democracies and private sectors reflecting that Africa is indeed open for business.\u00a0 Be proud of the fact that you are a special member of 1,700 young leaders from all sectors who have been positively impacted by your experiences at the YALI RLC based here in Accra.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Deprez also lauded the alumni on their achievements, and observed that the American people through USAID-West Africa is proud to sponsor the YALI Regional Leadership Center in partnership with other sponsors.<\/p>\n<p>Ms. Balky Buba congratulated the youth and urged them, \u201cas a Cameroonian, to work towards empowering African youth across borders because together we believe in Africa. Our hopes are intertwined, we share the same aspirations for a more peaceful and prosperous future looking beyond our own respective countries into the continent and world at large. To succeed, we must advance peace and welcome the immense talents and contributions of all citizens, especially women and girls to truly promote development.\u00a0 Our generation has the responsibility to build that better future which is possible, and will\u00a0 come through our efforts and dedication.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The YALI West Africa Regional Leadership Center provides high quality training, mentoring, and networking support to hundreds of young leaders in business, civic leadership, and public management.
