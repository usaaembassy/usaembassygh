Palmer<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>World AIDS Day<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>December 1, 2022, 10:00 a.m.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Good morning!<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m pleased to be here with you today to share this commemoration of World AIDS Day in\u00a0Accra.<\/p>\n<p>World AIDS Day is not only a time to remember the millions of lives lost to this terrible disease\u00a0since the first cases of AIDS were identified 41 years ago. It is also a time to educate young<br \/>\npeople and communities, and empower people living with HIV, as we move toward eradicating\u00a0AIDS once and for all.<\/p>\n<p>PEPFAR has been operating in Ghana for 20 years and has saved many lives. Let me tell you\u00a0about one. Gifty is a 52-year-old woman residing in Ahafo region. She started getting sick and\u00a0couldn\u2019t understand why. She was ostracized by her family and community and even called a\u00a0witch. Her business suffered. Her brother tried to help and get medicine \u2013 without even telling\u00a0her what it was or what she had. The medicine ran out and her condition worsened. She became\u00a0almost blind and was deathly ill. Then, a PEPFAR- funded HIV case manager came to her\u00a0house. After counseling, Gifty was tested for HIV and immediately put on treatment. Today,\u00a0her condition has turned around. She was able to restart her trading activities, selling at the local<br \/>\nmarket and receives regular customers without attracting discrimination or stigma. Gifty is\u00a0among 342 people in four districts in the Ahafo region who were able to resume treatment thanks\u00a0to PEPFAR.<\/p>\n<p>In the last three years, the world and Ghana have been challenged with multiple disease\u00a0outbreaks. As the COVID-19 pandemic finally was showing signs of slowing down, Ghana was\u00a0hit with unprecedented Marburg and monkeypox outbreaks. Russia\u2019s unprovoked attack on\u00a0Ukraine exacerbated already high levels of global food insecurity that have resulted from a\u00a0combination of the COVID-19 pandemic, climate shocks, and humanitarian crises. More than\u00a0ever, these emergencies highlight the need for us to work together. We need to strengthen public\u00a0health surveillance and response systems and to create sustainable economic growth, to foster\u00a0greater resilience.<\/p>\n<p>The United States led the global response to COVID and mobilized donors to address global\u00a0food insecurity. The United States is also a leader on global efforts to combat the HIV\/AIDS\u00a0epidemic. The United States has invested more than $100 billion in the global HIV response\u00a0through PEPFAR and as the leading donor to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and\u00a0Malaria.<\/p>\n<p>Through PEPFAR, the U.S. government has saved more than 21 million lives, prevented\u00a0millions of HIV infections, and helped over a dozen countries control their HIV epidemic. We\u00a0continue to assist countries to meet the UNAIDS 95-95-95 HIV treatment target by 2030.<\/p>\n<p>U.S. support for Ghana\u2019s health sector is long-term and high impact. From maternal and child\u00a0health, HIV, malaria to water sanitation, hygiene, and more.<\/p>\n<p>In the past 14 years, we\u2019ve invested over $140 million dollars to help Ghanaians slow the spread\u00a0of HIV, while supporting people and families living with HIV with lifesaving medications.<\/p>\n<p>Our collective efforts have resulted in a phenomenal increase in people who are on lifesaving\u00a0and transmission-breaking treatment. \u201cU\u201d \u2013 Undetectable HIV equals \u201cU\u201d \u2013 Untransmittable\u00a0HIV.<\/p>\n<p>Together, we can break the cycle of transmission. Preventing new HIV infections and\u00a0supporting those with HIV\/AIDS is not just about medication, state-of-the art supply chain\u00a0laboratory and information systems; it\u2019s also about education and reducing stigma and\u00a0discrimination about HIV infection.<\/p>\n<p>PEPFAR Ghana supports community service organizations to address stigma, encourage people\u00a0to get HIV testing and, for those who test positive, start treatment as quickly as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Ghana still needs to bring its HIV\/AIDS epidemic under control. This cannot be done by resting\u00a0on our laurels or ignoring emerging threats to our collective work with the Ghana Health\u00a0Services, the Ghana AIDS Commission, and other partners.<\/p>\n<p>First, we need to work together to ensure that HIV-related commodities are procured with no\u00a0interruption in treatment and test kits are available to identify cases. We must ensure that\u00a0Ghana\u2019s current economic crisis does not affect the availability of anti-retrovirals, HIV test kits,\u00a0and viral load testing reagents. Public health depends on it.<\/p>\n<p>Second, we must be vigilant about proposed policies that will negatively affect the fight against\u00a0HIV\/AIDS. I\u2019m talking about the proposed anti-LGBTQI+ bill in Parliament, which is a threat\u00a0to public order and public health, if people living with HIV, or those at risk of getting HIV are\u00a0ostracized, marginalized, or stigmatized. We know that when people are stigmatized, they are\u00a0less likely to get tested, and less likely to get treated. That leads to more cases.<\/p>\n<p>Our progress will be set back if policies drive people living with HIV to conceal their status, hide\u00a0their sexual orientation, and avoid testing and treatment. Such laws will have deadly\u00a0consequences for the broader population as well. We saw that at the beginning of the AIDS\u00a0epidemic 40 years ago in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>We cannot achieve our goal to end HIV\/AIDS as a global health threat if we deny people\u2019s\u00a0human rights, or if we allow discrimination against people living with HIV\/AIDS.<\/p>\n<p>The global theme for this year\u2019s World AIDS Day is \u201cEqualize.\u201d This theme resonates here. We\u00a0know that equitable access to health care is an important part of gaining control of the HIV\/AIDS<br \/>\nepidemic here in Ghana. Ghana has taken the bold step to define its Universal Health Coverage\u00a0Vision for 2030: \u201cAll people in Ghana have timely access to high quality health services irrespective of their ability to pay at the point of use.\u201d Let\u2019s continue our work together to erase\u00a0barriers to quality HIV service access, such as stigma and discrimination, gender-based violence,\u00a0and discriminatory legislation that further marginalizes individuals \u2013 including the LGBTQI+\u00a0community, racial and ethnic minorities, and women and girls.<\/p>\n<p>If those living with HIV\/AIDS can access health care, testing, and lifesaving treatment without\u00a0discrimination, we will achieve on our goals. If people are not stigmatized or otherwise\u00a0discouraged from treatment, we will achieve our goals. As Ghana recovers from a serious\u00a0macroeconomic crisis, we hope Ghana will continue to uphold equitable access to health care\u00a0services and its commitment to achieving Universal Health Care.<\/p>\n<p>So, emphasizing again the global theme for this year\u2019s World AIDS Day: Equalize. I hope that\u00a0someday we will commemorate World AIDS Day in a truly equal world, where everyone can\u00a0equally enjoy their basic human rights without fear of criminalization or discrimination, where\u00a0everyone has equal access to health care, and where the lessons we learned from defeating the\u00a0AIDS pandemic will equip us to deal equitably and successfully with other health challenges.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Remarks by Ambassador Virginia E.
