Sullivan noted that: \u00a0\u201cThe arrival of the needed medical supplies underscores the results of the growing partnership between the United States of America and the Republic of Ghana to combat COVID-19, to save lives and protect the people of this nation.\u00a0 As confirmed cases gradually made their way to West Africa and eventually Ghana, these essential laboratory supplies became even more critical during this rapidly evolving crisis and would have remained stranded in Manchester, U.K., until sometime in May if not for the assistance of the U.S. Air Force. The United States commends the Government of Ghana for its strong efforts to combat this pandemic, and we are pleased to partner in its leading efforts.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>On behalf of AFRICOM, Air Force Brig. Gen. Leo Kosinski, the Command\u2019s Director for Logistics, said, &#8220;The emergence of COVID-19 has introduced some new hurdles we have had to consider in U.S. Africa Command&#8217;s Area of Responsibility. Movement of this shipment of critical medical supplies from the United Kingdom to Ghana represents one of many logistics moves executed recently despite operating in one of the most logistically challenging theaters to move people and materiel. The fact that so many professionals from multiple commands quickly came together to work through this particular requirement highlights our amazing and unique team of professionals. They are working together every day for the interests of the American people and our global partners even in the toughest of circumstances.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-20698\" title=\"3C4A0683\" src=\"https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/3C4A0683-750x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/3C4A0683-750x500.jpg 750w, https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/3C4A0683-350x233.jpg 350w, https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/3C4A0683-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/3C4A0683-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/3C4A0683-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/3C4A0683-200x133.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The April 24 delivery of medical supplies to Ghana follows other critical U.S. military support in the health sector, such as the delivery of two state-of-the-art Level II Field Hospitals that Ambassador Sullivan handed over to the Ghana Armed Forces (GAF) on February 4 on behalf of the United States through the U.S. Government\u2019s Africa Peacekeeping Rapid Response Partnership program. \u00a0One of these hospitals is already being utilized to support the Government of Ghana&#8217;s COVID-19 response efforts in Accra.<\/p>\n<p>NAMRU-3 Ghana Detachment is a collaborator within the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch Global Emerging Infections Surveillance partner network and has supported influenza surveillance for both human and avian influenza strains in Ghana since 2007.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">###<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>ACCRA, Ghana \u2013 On April 24, a U.S. Air Force C-130J aircraft from the 86th Airlift Wing in Ramstein Air Base, Germany arrived at Kotoka International Airport to deliver medical supplies to the Government of Ghana in support of its COVID-19 response efforts.\u00a0 The delivery included approximately 2,500 kilograms of medical cargo and supplies provided &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1058,"featured_media":20696,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_gpalab_slo_mission_select":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[37,44],"tags":[8189,9423],"class_list":["post-20699","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-news","category-press-releases","tag-africom","tag-covid-19-medical-supplies"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) -
