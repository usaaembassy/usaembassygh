Your efforts will make Ghana more competitive in the global market. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It has now been just over 17 years since the African Growth and Opportunity Act was signed into law. \u00a0As you know, in 2015, our Congress renewed the law for another 10 years, demonstrating again the U.S. government\u2019s desire to help Africa reach its full economic potential. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">AGOA is an opportunity for Ghana to access the U.S. marketplace, increase exposure for \u201cmade in Ghana\u201d goods, and create more jobs. \u00a0However, Ghana has not taken as much advantage of AGOA as I had hoped. \u00a0In 2015, Ghana exported $9 million worth of goods under AGOA. \u00a0In 2016, Ghana exported $29 million worth of goods, of which only $12 million was for non-oil goods. \u00a0While this upward trend is encouraging, this number should increase substantially if Ghana is to be fully integrated into the global economy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One example of how Ghana <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">has<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> been able to take advantage of AGOA is through the apparel industry. \u00a0I would like to take a moment to recognize Salma Salifu. \u00a0Salma is the Managing Director of Dignity\u2013Do the Right Thing, which manufactures apparel for distribution in the U.S. market. \u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dignity\u2013Do the Right Thing (DTRT) is now the largest Ghanaian exporter of apparel. \u00a0The company manufactures 25,000 garments a day and exports approximately $1 million a month to the United States. \u00a0Starting in 2014 with 145 sewing machines, Salma now employs approximately 1,600 workers, most of whom are women. \u00a0Over the next year, with support from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), we expect Dignity-DTRT to expand that workforce to almost 3,000 workers \u2014 and to increase AGOA exports from that factory <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">alone<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> by $20 million annually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Salma and Dignity\u2013Do the Right Thing are examples of the good things the United States and Ghana can do together. \u00a0I encourage other businesses in this room to learn from Salma\u2019s experience and work together to drive job creation and economic growth in Ghana. \u00a0Can you imagine the difference if \u2014 three years from now \u2014 10 or 20 or 100 local businesses could share similar success stories? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With that in mind, I want to mention a new publication launched by USAID\u2019s West Africa Trade and Investment Hub, called AGOA ABCs. \u00a0This publication outlines the step-by-step process that a Ghanaian business should take to export duty free to the United States through AGOA. \u00a0Copies are available for you in the back of the room.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I am encouraged by the attendance of everyone here today. \u00a0I sincerely hope that after this validation event, companies will do more to take advantage of AGOA, and that the Government of Ghana will set forth additional policies that will enable the private sector to flourish.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ghana has tremendous potential to be \u201cthe trade gateway of Africa.\u201d \u00a0But the choice is ultimately up to the government and the people of Ghana: \u00a0What do you want the future of Ghana to be? \u00a0The United States is ready to work together with you to create an enabling business environment \u2014 one that will build upon Ghana\u2019s stable economic and political foundation, and create jobs for citizens of both our countries. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In fact, we are looking to the annual AGOA Forum in Lome, Togo, August 8-10, as well as to a third competitiveness forum to be organized by the Business Council for International Understanding later this year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Together, let\u2019s grow Ghanaian exports! \u00a0Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Honorable Minister of Trade and Industry Alan Kyerematen, Honorable Deputy Ministers, Heads of Private Sector Associations, Media representatives, Colleagues, Distinguished guests: Good morning. \u00a0I am pleased to be here today with business leaders who are working to forge connections and strengthen commercial ties between the United States and Ghana, and beyond. \u00a0Thank you to the &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1058,"featured_media":17785,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_gpalab_slo_mission_select":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[4,37,54,1161],"tags":[4070,4068],"class_list":["post-17784","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-ambassador","category-news","category-speeches","category-trade","tag-agoa","tag-trade"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Remarks by Ambassador Robert P.
