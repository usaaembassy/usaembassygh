Sullivan delivered remarks on November 17, 2020 at the graduation ceremony of the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Academy for Women Entrepreneurs (AWE) second cohort.\u00a0 Hosted by the Embassy\u2019s implementing partner, the event took place at the Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI) Regional Leadership Center located in the Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration.<\/p>\n<p>AWE follows the DreamBuilder course developed by the Thunderbird School of Global Management in Arizona.\u00a0 This online program provides flexibility to budding women entrepreneurs, who follow the course at their own pace, with supplemental sessions facilitated by experienced women entrepreneurs and subject matter experts in finance, marketing, and logistics.\u00a0 AWE provides online education resources, fosters networks that support access to mentorships, and connects women through existing U.S. government exchange programs.\u00a0 Participants from the second AWE cohort included entrepreneurs from the agricultural, food and beverage, cosmetics, personal care, and textile sectors.<\/p>\n<p>During the ceremony, Ambassador Sullivan applauded the 48 cohort members and encouraged them to remain resilient and determined saying, \u201cAll of us here today know how much women business owners, both in the informal and formal sectors, contribute to and drive Ghana\u2019s economic prosperity.\u00a0 In addition to boosting economic growth, investing in women produces a multiplier effect because women reinvest a large portion of their income in their families and communities.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>AWE is a part of the U.S. Women\u2019s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative, a whole-of-government effort to advance global women\u2019s economic empowerment, established in February 2019.\u00a0 Since the program\u2019s inception, 78 Ghanaian female entrepreneurs have completed the AWE program.\u00a0 AWE was a pilot program in 2019 in 26 countries, including 10 in Africa: Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. \u00a0Since then, the program has expanded to over 50 countries and has trained over 7,000 women.

Sullivan\u2019s As Prepared Remarks<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>at the Academy of Women Entrepreneurs (AWE) Cohort Two <\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Certificate Ceremony <\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>YALI RLC Rooftop, GIMPA \u00a0Tuesday, November 17, 2020, 10:00am-12:00pm <\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Good morning!<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m so glad to be with you today.\u00a0 I know that this is the first opportunity for us to be together, and for all of you to meet each other in-person, so it really is a special occasion.<\/p>\n<p>Today\u2019s ceremony is also well-timed, as this week marks Global Entrepreneurship Week.\u00a0 Global Entrepreneurship Week includes the participation of millions of entrepreneurs, investors, policymakers, and educators across 165 countries. \u00a0It\u2019s wonderful to celebrate with all of you, as you mark this important step in your entrepreneurial journeys.<\/p>\n<p>Last year, I was honored to launch the Academy of Women Entrepreneurs (AWE) right here on the GIMPA campus with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs, Marie Royce. \u00a0Later in the year, I was honored and delighted to speak at the graduation of the very first cohort.<\/p>\n<p>AWE is the State Department\u2019s flagship program supporting the Women\u2019s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative (W-GDP).\u00a0 W-GDP aims to reach 50 million women worldwide \u2013 including all 48 of you!<\/p>\n<p>Over the past year, we\u2019ve all developed new ways of working during a global pandemic. AWE is truly the right program for this moment \u2013 an online training program designed for busy women entrepreneurs. I can think of no other group better equipped to adapt to the new normal with such determination, resilience, and creativity.<\/p>\n<p>As the motto of AWE Ghana states, you are \u201c<u>women without limits<\/u>!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Over the past two months, you\u2019ve gone beyond \u201csurvive\u201d to \u201cthrive,\u201d completing both the online Dreambuilder course and the fully virtual facilitated sessions as you mastered online interactions and training.\u00a0\u00a0 You\u2019ve gained new skills and learned how to use new tools to create and grow your businesses, raise capital, and network with other successful business owners.<\/p>\n<p>I wonder how many of you felt confident when you signed up for AWE that you would be able to complete a 100% online course.\u00a0 At times most of us, including me, have had to \u201cfake it \u2018til you make it\u201d as we gained experience and grew professionally.You stepped up to a challenge, and that is exactly what AWE is designed to do \u2013 to help women all over the world overcome challenges and fulfill their economic potential. To become \u201c<u>women without limits<\/u>!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Since the onset of the global pandemic, I\u2019ve heard inspiring stories of resiliency and innovation in my interactions with alumni of U.S. government- sponsored exchange programs, including AWE. \u00a0Early on, I met virtually with several women entrepreneurs \u00a0to see how they were managing business with COVID-19.\u00a0 The problems they faced were unlike any they had ever expected when they jumped into the business world.\u00a0 I heard about challenges such as learning to re-open a workplace with fewer workers due to social distancing protocols while striving to meet the same deadlines and production figures.\u00a0 These women demonstrated their strength not by becoming discouraged, but by adapting and taking a strategic approach.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m confident that you will also rise to the challenge of this moment.\u00a0 I know that you all had to develop business plans as part of the Dreambuilder course. \u00a0I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t easy to think about expanding your business during a pandemic.\u00a0 But I also know that our current global crisis does present opportunities, for those who approach the situation with an innovative and energetic mindset.<\/p>\n<p>Among our AWE cohort two participants, we have caterers, fashion designers, skin- and hair-care producers, delivery providers, agricultural producers, food processors, and clothing manufacturers, to name just a few!\u00a0 I can\u2019t wait to see how you all rise to the challenge of creating new ways to do business in our changing world.<\/p>\n<p>All of us here today know how much women business owners, both in the informal and formal sectors, contribute to and drive Ghana\u2019s economic prosperity.\u00a0 Investing in women produces a multiplier effect because women reinvest a large portion of their income in their families and communities, thereby boosting economic growth.<\/p>\n<p>These concepts are at the heart of the AWE program.\u00a0 To succeed, you need focused time dedicated to professional growth and improving your businesses.\u00a0 As any busy working woman can attest, time is a precious commodity.<\/p>\n<p>I commend you, our AWE Cohort Two participants, for taking the time and investing it where it counts \u2013 in yourself and your future!\u00a0 I\u2019m confident you will see this decision pay off Before too long, if you haven\u2019t already.<\/p>\n<p>I offer my special thanks to the Embassy\u2019s partner in implementing the AWE program, the YALI Regional Leadership Center team, under the direction of Dr. Shola Safo-Duodo.\u00a0 Shola, I remember when you and your team launched AWE last year; you should be proud of the way your hard work has lifted up so many women and led to job creation.<\/p>\n<p>The United States Embassy is also grateful to the powerful network of alumnae: \u00a0women entrepreneurs and business leaders who have devoted their time to facilitate the Dreamweaver courses.\u00a0 These are your \u201celder sisters\u201d and \u201caunties\u201d who have collaborated with Shola and the RLC team to guide you through the course, sharing their experiences and knowledge along the way.\u00a0 These women represent a range of U.S. government exchange programs, notably the African Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship Program, the Fortune Women\u2019s Mentoring Program, the Mandela Washington Fellowship, and, of course, AWE Cohort One participants.<\/p>\n<p>We at the Embassy are fortunate to be able to offer support to women entrepreneurs, though exchange programs, seminars, networking opportunities, small grant funds, and training programs like AWE.<\/p>\n<p>We look forward to continued collaboration and partnership with you and your networks to inspire and motivate other women to achieve economic independence.<\/p>\n<p>To the AWE Cohort two graduates: I salute you all!\u00a0 You have an opportunity to model how powerful women business leaders and entrepreneurs can become the driving force for boosting the prosperity of your communities, and ultimately of your nation.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for your kind attention. You are awesome.\u00a0 Ayikoo to all of you!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Accra, GHANA\u2014 Marking Global Entrepreneurship Week, U.S. Ambassador to Ghana Stephanie S.
