Sullivan<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Opening Session of the U.S.-Ghana Business Forum<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>September 8, 2021 | 1:30 p.m. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Thank you, Ayesha, for the introduction.<\/p>\n<p>Distinguished guests, ladies, and gentlemen, all protocols observed, it is a real pleasure for me to participate in the opening session of this Business Forum organized by the American Chamber of Commerce in Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. and Ghana share a longstanding, strong, and dynamic relationship.\u00a0 We work together on a broad spectrum of issues, including public health, education, entrepreneurship, security, and perhaps most important for this audience, building business relationships.<\/p>\n<p>American businesses and investors deepen the ties between our two countries.\u00a0 We greatly appreciate the leadership of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ghana in advancing this aspect of our long-term partnership.<\/p>\n<p>There are well over a hundred U.S. firms operating in Ghana.\u00a0 From the development and exploration of major oil fields by Kosmos Energy to the transformation of healthcare delivery by Zipline, which transports lifesaving medical products and vaccines to remote areas by drone, companies are finding success in Ghana and contributing to prosperity in both our countries.\u00a0 American innovators are eager to partner with Ghanaian businesses across a wide range of industries that support their work, from logistics to raw materials, and much, much more.<\/p>\n<p>I am very pleased that despite the pandemic, this year several well-known American companies and brands have chosen Ghana as a market for growth: Twitter announced in April that it will open its West African headquarters here; the Fareast Mercantile Company recently opened a new Estee Lauder cosmetics store as well as two Domino\u2019s pizza franchise stores in Accra; and in May, United Airlines reopened its direct non-stop route between Washington, DC and Accra.\u00a0 That same United flight delivered more than 1.2 million Moderna COVID-19 vaccines to Ghana last Saturday morning.\u00a0 Along with Delta Airlines\u2019 non-stop from New York, business travelers on both sides of the ocean have direct access to each other\u2019s markets.<\/p>\n<p>Ghanaian firms, too, are succeeding in the U.S. market, where consumers are benefiting from quality made products made right here in Ghana.\u00a0 For example, Emi-Beth Aku-Quantson is the dynamic owner of Kawa Moka coffee and an alumna of our Embassy exchange programs. She landed a contract with Boston-based 7-11 stores to supply hundreds of well-known convenience stores with Ghanaian-grown coffee.\u00a0 American firm Bunge Loders Croklaan, is processing shea butter here in Ghana at a state-of-the-art fractionation facility in Tema, creating jobs locally, and exporting shea products under the African Growth and Opportunity Act, or AGOA.\u00a0 Today, more than 6,500 goods can be exported duty-free from Ghana to the United States.\u00a0 Last year, Ghana exported almost $136 million in goods to the United States, from mostly Ghanaian companies.<\/p>\n<p>As Africa\u2019s economy, and economies around the globe, dust themselves off from the effects of the pandemic, the opportunity is ripe for the African Continental Free Trade Area to deliver on its objective to expand intra-regional trade and capture new foreign direct investment \u2013 with Ghana in the lead as host of the Secretariat.\u00a0 The AfCFTA is a game changer not only for doing business across the continent, but also for how the world thinks of Africa.\u00a0 And Ghana is well positioned to capitalize on the new economic synergies and opportunities for growth that AfCFTA can bring to the continent.<\/p>\n<p>I am told there is a Ghanaian proverb that I think fits quite well here: If an opportunity is not taken when it comes, it passes away.<\/p>\n<p>That entrepreneurial spirit of working hard, taking advantage of opportunities, and finding success is alive and well in Ghana, and it\u2019s a cornerstone of the U.S. &#8211; Ghana commercial relationship.\u00a0 Small and large companies alike, starting with an innovative idea, growing and expanding, then seeking partners and customers across the ocean \u2013 are what keep our trade relationship so active and vibrant.<\/p>\n<p>I remember during the visit of then-President Bill Clinton in March 1998, during my earlier assignment in Ghana, first hearing of Ghana as \u00a0the \u201cGateway to Africa,\u201d and I have watched our economic relationship grow and mature since then.<\/p>\n<p>For American companies participating today who might be new to the Ghanaian market, I say to you: don\u2019t let this opportunity pass!<\/p>\n<p>From perfume to pizza, from tweets to flights, U.S. companies are finding what they seek in Ghana: a growing economy, political stability, security, and the enormous promise of the African Continental Free Trade Area.<\/p>\n<p>At our Mission in Accra, we have a dedicated interagency deal team focused on supporting U.S. companies, helping them to find partners, navigate the regulatory environment, and win deals.\u00a0 You can contact my team directly at <a href=\"mailto:AccraDealTeam@state.gov\">AccraDealTeam@state.gov<\/a>.\u00a0 I encourage all interested American firms to seek the support of our Deal Team, made up of the U.S. Commercial Service, the Foreign Agriculture Service, the Trade and Development Agency, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and the State Department\u2019s Economic Section.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for your kind attention.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Remarks by Ambassador Stephanie S.
