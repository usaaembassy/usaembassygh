Welcome:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Honorable Deputy Ministry of Energy<\/li>\n<li>Officials from Accra Technical University, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi (KNUST), and the University of Energy and Natural Resources (UENR), Sunyani.<\/li>\n<li>MiDA Board Chair and members<\/li>\n<li>MiDA management and staff<\/li>\n<li>Students, professors, staff, and consultants partnered with the Sustainable Energy Service Centers.<\/li>\n<li>My colleagues from the Millennium Challenge Corporation Resident Country Mission and my Public Affairs colleagues at the U.S. Embassy<\/li>\n<li>Members of the media<\/li>\n<li>All other guests.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It\u2019s a pleasure to be with you here today representing the U.S. government and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC).<\/p>\n<p>The Millennium Challenge Corporation Ghana Power Compact invested $316 million across Ghana to improve power infrastructure, advance energy efficiency programs, and expand opportunities for women and youth in the power sector.<\/p>\n<p>I was honored to attend the recent inauguration of the Kasoa Bulk Supply Point with a number of colleagues here and witnessed the strength of the U.S.-Ghana partnership. \u00a0I\u2019m pleased to join you all today as part of another celebration \u2013 and it really is a celebration \u2013 the inauguration of three Sustainable Energy Service Centers established under the Ghana Power Compact.<\/p>\n<p>With implementing partners at MiDA, and in partnership with entities like the Energy Commission, the Electricity Company of Ghana or ECG, the Ghana Standards Authority, municipal authorities, and technical universities like ATU, the MCC Ghana Power Compact invested $25 million dollars to advance energy efficiency programs to reduce electricity demand, conserve today\u2019s energy resources, and prepare Ghana to address the challenges of a changing global climate.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ve heard it from my colleagues, we are facing a climate crisis, so we need to take every step possible to mitigate its effects, including conserving energy and promoting efficient energy consumption by building out Ghana\u2019s energy auditing capacity through programs like this.<\/p>\n<p>Energy auditing is a growing industry where students and early professionals in science, technology, and engineering can forge a career path. \u00a0These new Sustainable Energy Service Centers will provide the technical training needed for future energy auditors.<\/p>\n<p>But this project was only one part of the $25 million dollars the Ghana Power Compact invested to advance energy efficiency programs in Ghana. Indulge me for a moment, while I talk about other results of this investment.\u00a0We also established the first Air Conditioning and Refrigerator Test Laboratory in West Africa at the Ghana Standards Authority to help Ghana enforce its appliance energy efficiency standards and regulations.<\/p>\n<p>We reviewed and upgraded existing regulations for appliance standards and labeling to better reflect current technology.\u00a0 We retrofitted high energy consuming appliances at Ghana government institutions, such as ministry buildings, universities, hospitals, to reduce energy consumption and save government funds. We replaced streetlight bulbs with more energy efficient LED lights to reduce lifecycle costs while illuminating neighborhoods for safety and security. We piloted a school curriculum module to raise awareness about energy efficiency and conservation among Ghana\u2019s youth.<\/p>\n<p>And today, the reason we\u2019re all here, as we establish three new centers for energy auditing within Ghana\u2019s technical universities. \u00a0Students will learn a trade that makes money and saves money, reducing energy costs and giving talented students a sustainable career path in energy.<\/p>\n<p>This illustrates the comprehensive partnership between the United States and Ghana as we work together to prepare for a more prosperous and climate resilient future.<\/p>\n<p>Congratulations to all of you who have been a part of making this a reality.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Remarks by Deputy Chief of Mission Nicole Chulick MCC Ghana Power Compact Sustainable Energy Service Centers Inauguration Tuesday, July 26, 2022 at 10:00 am at Accra Technical University -As Delivered- Good morning.
