We know that when women succeed, children are healthier and better educated, and communities thrive.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This principle is at the heart of the AWE program.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Designed for busy working women like today\u2019s graduates, AWE is a facilitated online course divided into 13 modules.\u00a0 Participants complete one module per week and gather once a week for an informative session facilitated by trainers and subject matter experts. These sessions become a haven for the participants over the 13-week course, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">giving the women time dedicated solely to improving their businesses.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As many a busy working woman can attest, time is a precious commodity, and I commend all of our AWE Cohort One participants for taking the time and making the commitment to invest in your professional growth. I am confident you and your businesses will see positive results in the near future.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I know that you have all been working on your business plans as well throughout the Dreamweaver course. Among our inaugural AWE cohort participants, we have pastry chefs, fashion designers, skin and hair care product creators, caterers, interior designers, online grocers, cleaning suppliers, and garment manufacturers, to name just a few!\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We are certain that with the AWE certification, you will each go on <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">to strengthen and grow your respective businesses.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">On a personal note, I would also urge all of you to stay connected to your new network <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and continue to support one another. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Throughout my career I have relied on the advice and wisdom of my elders, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">my peers, and my friends, and I make an effort do the same for others. This spirit of solidarity and friendship brings to mind one of my favorite African sayings: \u201cThe path to a friend\u2019s house is never far.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">May this be true for all of your entrepreneurial journeys. Make time to support each other <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">even as you are busy chasing your dreams. It is also important to strengthen and grow your networks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">My special thanks go to the Embassy\u2019s tireless partner in implementing the AWE program, the YALI Regional Leadership Center team, under the direction of Dr. Shola Safo-Duodo.\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When this program was announced, we immediately knew you were the right partner to help us get AWE off the ground in Ghana, and you have done so well \u2013 Ayekoo!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">My team and I are also grateful to the powerful network of alumnae women entrepreneurs and business leaders who have taken the time to facilitate <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the Dreamweaver courses. These are your \u201celder sisters\u201d and \u201caunties\u201d who have collaborated with Shola and the RLC team to bring the AWE program to life.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Representing the African Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship Program (AWEP), the Fortune Women\u2019s Mentoring Program, and the Mandela Washington Fellowship, these women have mentored and supported our AWE participants.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Brigitte, Nana Yaa, Adjo, Innocentia and Nana Charlotte \u2013 please stand so we can applaud you.\u00a0 Wayade3!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Finally, I would like to thank the families of the AWE participants for supporting your sisters, wives, mothers, and daughters in their pursuit of entrepreneurial success. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Know that when we are organizing training courses such as AWE that focus exclusively on women, we are not seeking better treatment for women than men.\u00a0 Rather, we believe women should be treated as equals with the same rights and opportunities as our male counterparts.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It bears repeating: when women succeed, the whole family succeeds!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I\u2019ll close by sharing my pride in the spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship that has powered the U.S. economy and paved the way for prosperity and stability.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That said, American entrepreneurship has been male-dominated for most of our history. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We can do better!\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Those of you here today and those whom you will empower have an opportunity to write a new story of powerful women entrepreneurs who become the driving force for increased peace and prosperity throughout Africa and the world.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I believe your cohort motto says it all: AWE \u2013 Women without Limits!\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thank you, and congratulations again to all of you!\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ambassador Stephanie S.
