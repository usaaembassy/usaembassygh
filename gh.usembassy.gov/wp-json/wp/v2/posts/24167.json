This is the second year I have seen you for this exercise \u2013 as promised it is bigger and better this year.\u00a0 I would like to note that there are three major exercises happening in Ghana this month. \u00a0Flintlock, Obangame Express, and African Lion.\u00a0 These naval, special forces, and conventional forces exercises reflect our full engagement and cooperation to support security in the region.<\/p>\n<p>To our distinguished international partners, Akwaaba and to our gracious hosts, the Ghana Armed Forces, Medaase.\u00a0 After a year of planning and two weeks of intense exercise execution by nearly 1,300 combined multi-national forces, the U.S. Special Operations Command \u2013 Africa, U.S. Army Southern European Task Force \u2013 Africa, and Ghana Armed Forces culminated this effort with the demonstration we have just seen, including forces of thirty-one nations.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to thank everyone involved in this enormous effort.\u00a0 \u00a0Flintlock is a long-running multinational effort dating back to 2005.\u00a0 Our commitment to security in the region is long-term, but today\u2019s exercise is also very timely.\u00a0 We don\u2019t have to look very far to see security threats from violent extremism in the Sahel.\u00a0 We, like all of our partners, are concerned by the security, humanitarian, and political crises unfolding in the Sahel.\u00a0Going forward, African Lion is here to stay in Ghana and to continue strengthening ties in coastal West Africa.\u00a0 African Lion is the U.S. Army\u2019s premier exercise focused on deployment and mobilization of conventional forces to counter shared threats in Africa.<\/p>\n<p>The region has witnessed a dramatic increase in the strength and influence of violent extremist groups.\u00a0 Threats to civilians, reports of human rights abuses and violations, and levels of displacement and humanitarian need are all on the rise.<\/p>\n<p>As we\u2019ve seen in the Sahel, violent extremism thrives when state authorities are absent; when the delivery of services is weak; when democracy is fragile or fleeting; when justice is inaccessible; and when economic and political exclusion prevail.<\/p>\n<p>Along these same lines, during African Lion, we\u2019ve worked together on medical outreach events in communities here and in the north, as part of the exercises.\u00a0 These mobile clinics provide medical screenings and basic health care, while helping build trust between at-risk communities and security forces.\u00a0 It\u2019s that trust and connection that can truly improve security.<\/p>\n<p>Activities like these conducted under African Lion and Flintlock reflect our broader work in Ghana.\u00a0 We know that the threat of violent extremism cannot be addressed through security forces alone.\u00a0 Under the Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability, the United States has made a long-term commitment to support local communities at risk of expanded conflict as they seek to solidify social cohesion, provide economic opportunities to vulnerable populations, strengthen our military-to-military relationship, and bolster the capacity of the Ghanaian security services to ensure that Ghana remains resilient in the face of an increasing threat from violent extremist organizations. \u00a0Since 2022, Congress has approved over $85 million for SPCPS implementation for Coastal West Africa, with an additional $45 million expected this year.<\/p>\n<p>These past two weeks, the Ghana Armed Forces have demonstrated that in addition to being a net exporter of security and stability through peacekeeping, it is a capable leader in highly specialized operations as well as command and control. \u00a0This is one of many reasons the United States is committed to supporting the Ghana Armed Forces through continued training and technical support.<\/p>\n<p>Our longstanding partnership is based on shared democratic values and a shared history.\u00a0 Ghana\u2019s commitments to freedom of assembly, interfaith religious tolerance, and respect for human rights are foundational to modern democracies and are a shining example of democratic norms.<\/p>\n<p>Through Flintlock and African Lion, we have demonstrated that our bilateral relationship is strong, productive, and mutually beneficial.\u00a0 The United States is proud to partner with Ghana as a leader in West Africa, working together on regional security, investing in people through our long-term development relationship, protecting democratic institutions, and advancing our mutual prosperity.<\/p>\n<p>The number of senior leaders here today speaks volumes to the importance of these exercises and our focus on security in coastal West Africa. \u00a0Ghana\u2019s efforts are backed by international and regional partners who value Ghana\u2019s leadership and stand together with our African Partners to push back on threats against our common values and democratic norms.\u00a0 Thank you for coming.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ambassador Palmer\u2019s Remarks U.S. Special Operations Command \u2013 Africa Exercise Flintlock 2024, Distinguished Visitor Demonstration, Tamale, Ghana Friday, May 24, 2024 *Remarks As Prepared* Good afternoon and welcome back!
