the Government of Ghana, international partners, fisherfolk, and local communities &#8211; to restore the health of the sector.\u00a0 We must go far beyond this project\u2019s milestones to reestablish Ghana\u2019s marine fisheries, even when the challenges require decisions that are not popular. \u00a0Cooperation among the Government of Ghana, international partners, civil society, academia, and the fisheries associations is needed to set Ghana\u2019s fisheries on a more sustainable path, in alignment with the vision of Ghana\u2019s National Fisheries Management Plan.<\/p>\n<p>Our new USAID Country Development Cooperation Strategy is focused on catalyzing behavior changes to achieve a common goal.\u00a0 Drawing on the lessons learned from our seven years of work in the coastal fisheries sector through SFMP and other activities, we are calling on all stakeholders to work together to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Accelerate the shift from a top-down management approach to a cooperative one, based on real partnership under the new National Co-management Policy involving the regulator, the community, and industry;<\/li>\n<li>Ensure that management decisions are informed by science and data to protect the vital contributions of coastal and marine ecosystems to provide nutrition and livelihoods;<\/li>\n<li>Better align the need to protect the livelihoods of Ghana\u2019s artisanal fisherfolk with the biological health of the fish species that make these economic opportunities possible; and<\/li>\n<li>Take bold steps to hold accountable those actors who violate the laws and regulations that are designed to protect Ghana marine fisheries from collapse and safeguard the interests of the Ghanaian people.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We stand ready to work together with the Government of Ghana to achieve these goals.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to express my appreciation to the University of Rhode Island and the partners of the Sustainable Fisheries Management Project for your efforts over the past seven years.\u00a0 We look forward to continuing to build on these achievements to address the growing urgency of the challenges that face Ghana\u2019s fisherfolk.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">###<\/p>\n<p><b>About Feed the Future<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Feed the Future is the U.S. Government\u2019s initiative to end global hunger.\u00a0 Led by USAID and driven by collaborative partnership across public and private sectors, including 11 U.S. Government agencies, Feed the Future addresses the root causes of poverty and hunger.\u00a0 This is done by boosting inclusive agriculture-led economic growth, resilience and nutrition in countries with great need and opportunity for improvement.<\/p>\n<p><b>About USAID<\/b><\/p>\n<p>USAID is the lead U.S. government agency that works to end extreme global poverty and enable resilient, democratic societies to realize their potential.\u00a0 USAID&#8217;s activities and strategic partnerships support Ghana&#8217;s journey to self-reliance and advances an integrated approach to development.\u00a0 It promotes accountability, sustainable systems, and inclusive development.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Accra, GHANA-\u00a0On March 30, 2021, U.S. Deputy Chief of Mission Christopher J.
