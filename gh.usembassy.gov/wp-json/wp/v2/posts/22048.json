The EC currently relies on third-party laboratory reports generated outside of Ghana. The laboratory will ensure these high energy-consuming electrical appliances imported into Ghana meet the Minimum Energy Performance Standard (MEPS) under the EC and support Ghana\u2019s National Appliance Standards and Labeling Systems Program.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About the Millennium Challenge Corporation<br \/>\n<\/strong>The Millennium Challenge Corporation is an independent U.S. government agency working to reduce global poverty through economic growth.\u00a0 Created in 2004, MCC provides time-limited grants and assistance to countries that meet rigorous standards for good governance, fighting corruption, and respecting democratic rights.\u00a0 More information at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mcc.gov\/\">mcc.gov<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>###<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">U.S. Ambassador Stephanie Sullivan<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">Remarks for the Energy Efficiency Testing Laboratory Inauguration<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">November 18, 2021 10:00 a.m. Ghana Standards Authority, Accra<br \/>\n-As Delivered-<\/p>\n<p>Good morning!<br \/>\nIt really is a good morning! I\u2019m pleased to be with you here today, representing the U.S. government \u00a0and the Millennium Challenge Corporation, or MCC, \u00a0for this happy occasion of the inauguration \u00a0of the Air Conditioner \u00a0and Refrigerator Test Laboratory at the Ghana Standards Authority.<\/p>\n<p>MCC is working in Ghana to increase economic growth and reduce poverty by providing a grant of $316 million dollars through the Ghana Power Compact program. \u00a0It\u2019s my first visit to the GSA, although I have driven by many times and admired the adinkra symbol.<\/p>\n<p>With implementing partners at the Millennium Development Authority, or MiDA, and in partnership with entities like the Ghana Standards Authority and Energy Commission,<\/p>\n<p>this part of the MCC Ghana Power Compact aims to advance energy efficiency programs to: reduce electricity demand, conserve today\u2019s energy resources, and prepare Ghana to address the challenges of a changing global climate.<\/p>\n<p>The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher.\u00a0 The climate crisis poses an existential threat to every human on the planet.\u00a0 In the follow up to COP 26, we need to adopt clean energy technologies and improve energy efficiency everywhere. This laboratory will put Ghana in a leadership position, helping to enforce strong efficiency standards, reducing emissions, and saving Ghanaians money. \u00a0It will help ensure high energy-consuming electrical appliances meet the Energy Commission\u2019s standards and will support Ghana\u2019s National Appliance Standards and Labeling Systems Program.<\/p>\n<p>This Air Conditioner and Refrigerator Test Laboratory will expand the capacity of the Ghana Standards Authority and the Energy Commission to assess the energy performance of appliances like air conditioners and refrigerators imported to Ghana and will ensure the more efficient use of the valuable resource we call electricity.<\/p>\n<p>This laboratory is only one part of the over $25 million the Ghana Power Compact has invested to advance energy efficiency programs in Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>We are also working on:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the review and upgrade of existing regulations for appliance standards and labeling to better reflect current technology;<\/li>\n<li>twenty legislative instruments, approved by the Ghana Standards Authority, Energy Commission, and Office of the Attorney General, that are awaiting review and promulgation by Parliament;<\/li>\n<li>the retrofitting of high energy-consuming appliances in Ghanaian government institutions, such as ministry buildings, universities, and hospitals, to reduce energy consumption and save government funds;<\/li>\n<li>the replacement of streetlight bulbs with more energy-efficient LED lights to reduce lifecycle costs while illuminating neighborhoods for safety and security;<\/li>\n<li>building capacity for energy auditing within Ghana\u2019s technical universities, with three new sustainable energy-auditing service centers under development.\u00a0 Students will learn a trade that makes money for them and saves money for their clients, while reducing energy usage and costs; and<\/li>\n<li>a pilot school curriculum module to raise awareness about energy efficiency and conservation among Ghana\u2019s youth.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The above list illustrates the comprehensive partnership between the United States, through MCC, and Ghana, as we work together to prepare for a more prosperous and climate-resilient future for the people of Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a mark of pride that the Air Conditioner and Refrigerator Test Laboratory will be the first laboratory of its kind in West Africa and will give the Ghana Standards Authority the resource it needs to be a world-class facility for enforcing energy efficiency standards and labeling. With this laboratory, Ghana has the capacity to become a regional gateway for importing appliances that can be tested and certified here for meeting quality standards in Ghana and beyond, thus supporting the regional economic integration objectives of the Africa Continental Free trade Area.<\/p>\n<p>Managing existing energy resources responsibly is an important complement to the Government of Ghana\u2019s efforts to bring more reliable electricity to its citizens and its businesses to meet economic needs. We have to be good stewards of the resources we have today, so those resources will be available for our children, and because our children are our future. \u00a0This reminds me of the African saying, \u201cParents look after their children when their children\u2019s teeth fall out, and children grow up to look after their parents when their parents\u2019 teeth fall out.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The $316 million MCC Ghana Power Compact is the U.S. government\u2019s contribution to a brighter, more energy efficient, and climate-resilient future for Ghana and the Ghanaian people. And this laboratory will go a long way towards improving energy efficiency in Ghana and beyond.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for your kind attention<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Accra, Ghana \u2013 U.S. Ambassador to Ghana Stephanie Sullivan joined Deputy Minister for Trade and Industry Michael Okyere Baafi, and other Ghanaian officials to formally inaugurate the new Air Conditioner and Refrigerator Test Laboratory at the Ghana Standards Authority (GSA) today.\u00a0 The U.S. government Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) funded $1.84 million for the project under &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1058,"featured_media":22050,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_gpalab_slo_mission_select":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[4,44,54,57,61,64],"tags":[7136,10006,6579,10004,6581],"class_list":["post-22048","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-ambassador","category-press-releases","category-speeches","category-success-stories","category-us-and-gh","category-us-agencies","tag-ambassador-sullivan","tag-ghana-standard-authority","tag-mcc","tag-mida","tag-milllenium-challenge-compact"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) -
