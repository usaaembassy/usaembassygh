In fact, while serving in Washington, I attended the meeting at which the PAC-DBIA members reported on their trip.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">During that visit to Ghana, the United States and Ghana signed the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Development and Implementation of Strategic Energy, Transportation and Other Priority Projects in Ghana to increase trade and investment between our two countries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Today\u2019s roundtable offers the opportunity for PAC-DBIA members to discuss and evaluate progress made on the goals of the MOU; learn how the pandemic has affected the MOU; and learn about priority and strategic projects in Ghana in which U.S. companies may participate by providing products or services, or as investors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the two and half years since I\u2019ve been the U.S. ambassador to Ghana, one of my top goals has been to increase trade and investment between the United States and Ghana. My embassy team works every day toward that goal.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In fact, the Embassy Deal Team is working with Ghanaian partners on a number of projects, including the rehabilitation of the water treatment plant and dam at the Weija Dam and the Begoro Municipality water project; a poultry-processing plant in Kumasi; feasibility studies for mini grids in the Afram Plains South region and for an aviation maintenance, repair, and overhaul facility at Kotoka International\u202fAirport; and construction of a data storage center, among others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Over 120 U.S. firms are operating in Ghana. From the development and exploration of major oil fields by Kosmos Energy to the transformation of healthcare delivery by Zipline,\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">which transports lifesaving medical products and vaccines to remote areas by drone \u2013 companies are finding success in Ghana and contributing to prosperity in both countries. American innovators are eager to partner with Ghanaian entrepreneurs across a wide spectrum of industries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And recently, several iconic American brands have either established their presence in Ghana, such as Domino\u2019s Pizza, Orkin Pest Control and United Airlines; or announced their intention to do so, as Twitter did in April. In fact, Twitter mentioned that one of the reasons it selected Ghana for its West Africa headquarters is Ghana\u2019s role as host of the African Continental Free Trade Area Secretariat. I\u2019m sure more U.S. companies will follow. As Ghana realizes its aspiration of being the gateway to Africa, first coined, I believe, during the visit of then-President Bill Clinton in March 1998, during my earlier assignment here, my team and I look forward to supporting U.S. businesses.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As we emerge from the tunnel of masked meetings and postponed events and the world economy revs back up, it\u2019s exciting to think about the enormous potential for increased trade and investment between the United States and Ghana and the next steps for continuing our mutual efforts under the MOU.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I look forward to a lively and informative roundtable discussion.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Remarks by Ambassador Stephanie S.
