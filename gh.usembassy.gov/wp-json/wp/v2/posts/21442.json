It exemplifies the continued importance of capacity building with our African partners and the goals set for Obangame Express 2021.<\/p>\n<p>Collaboration and cooperation between multiple nations and agencies were key to this success.The grounding of the container ship Ever Given in the Suez Canal underscores how important the global shipping routes are to the world&#8217;s economy and how interconnected the world has become. The blockage will divert shipping around the Cape of Good Hope, resulting in increased maritime traffic in the Gulf of Guinea.<\/p>\n<p>I challenge all stakeholders and exercise participants to continue to use the lessons, skills, and networks developed during Obangame Express to counter potential increased piracy and other maritime crimes and to protect the global commons.<\/p>\n<p>OE 21\u2019s Senior Leadership Symposium gathered experts from defense, industry, government, and other stakeholders to discuss maritime security issues in depth and work together towards a common goal.\u00a0 This collaboration with our African, European, North and South American partners plays a key role\u00a0in\u00a0maintaining\u00a0that security.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to thank all participants for their commitment to the exercise despite the additional hardship of the pandemic protocols.\u00a0 I\u2019d also like to thank the Exercise planners\u00a0 who took every precaution to ensure the health and safety of our sailors, partners, and allies.\u00a0 These COVID mitigation measures provide a template for the rest of this pandemic and the next.<\/p>\n<p>To conclude, I\u2019d like to thank U.S. Naval Forces Africa for organizing this event, as well as the Government of Ghana and the Ghana Armed Forces for providing a world-class venue to host this and other regional security partnership programs.\u00a0 And I\u2019d like to thank all of the participants once again and congratulate you on a successful exercise.\u00a0I wish you fair winds and following seas as you make your way back home.<\/p>\n<p>Medaase!
