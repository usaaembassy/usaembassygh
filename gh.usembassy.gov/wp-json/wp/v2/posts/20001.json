The courses have covered a variety of topics including Anti-Human Trafficking, Border Management, Digital Evidence Preservation, Improving Criminal Prosecutions and Cyber Forensic Investigations<\/p>\n<p>INL\/AME has been particularly responsive to Ghana\u2019s current needs and U.S. Embassy priorities. The AME program has also been critical in advancing the Security Governance Initiative (or SGI) by hosting the SGI Steering Committee Meetings and supporting SGI-related workshops.<\/p>\n<p>INL established the AME program with the aim of developing and implementing strategies to address threats and improve the security sector governance and capacity of partner nations. \u00a0The AME program has delivered great results across the African continent and the Middle East.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to AME, the RTC has hosted over 50 law enforcement training courses and workshops since 2015, and has a growing alumni database of 1431 criminal justice professionals in Ghana, with majority of alumni representing the following agencies:<\/p>\n<p>Judicial Service of Ghana (100)<\/p>\n<p>Ghana Police Service (95)<\/p>\n<p>Bureau of National Investigation (43)<\/p>\n<p>Ghana Prisons Service (31)<\/p>\n<p>Narcotics Control Board (31)<\/p>\n<p>While most of the participants come from Greater Accra, INL\/AME has trained delegates from every region in Ghana. This is a testament to the strong partnership the Government of Ghana shares with the United States Government.<\/p>\n<p>But after three years and 1431 individuals trained, our work is far from done.\u00a0 In fact, the emerging threats associated with breaches in border management give us more reason to strengthen our cooperation to attain our common interest of protecting our nations\u2019 borders and our peoples.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve seen the tangible results of our collaboration in many ways, from disrupting human traffickers to tracking down maritime pirates.<\/p>\n<p>Today\u2019s event is a celebration of a continuous collaboration to advance our mission and strive to strengthen our existing partnerships with our Alumni network, while seeking new opportunities to work together for a safer region and more secure world.<\/p>\n<p>Today\u2019s event does not only benefit the partnership between our countries.\u00a0 It also brings together AME alumni from various Ghanaian agencies with whom you may not cross paths on a daily basis. Today offers you opportunities to meet and get to know fellow officials who might be of assistance in your work or the work of your office.<\/p>\n<p>For example, police prosecutors may get to know CID investigators, Narcotics Control Board officers, or judges, and better understand each agency\u2019s role in furthering law enforcement efforts and access to justice in Ghana.\u00a0 I hope you take advantage of this day, and build your own database of relationships to have even better teamwork going forward.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for your kind attention.\u00a0 I look forward to the continued success of the INL\/AME program, and may the U.S.-Ghana partnership grow from strength to strength!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u00a0Stephanie S.
