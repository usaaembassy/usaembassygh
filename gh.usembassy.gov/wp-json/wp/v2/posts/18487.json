Jackson hosted a solemn memorial ceremony in honor of Private First Class (PFC) Emmanuel Mensah at the U.S. Embassy in Accra. The ceremony welcomed Private Mensah\u2019s relatives and friends as well as senior officials from the Government of Ghana (GoG), the Ghanaian armed forces, and members of the media and the U.S. Embassy. They included Minister of Defense Dominic Nitiwul and Minister of Interior Ambrose Derry. PFC Mensah\u2019s father Kwabena Mensah was represented by his uncles Ben Owusu Domena, Daniel Osei-Uwusu, and Andrew Kwadwo Oduro.<\/p>\n<p>The ceremony began with the playing of the national anthems of the Republic of Ghana and the United States of America, and was followed by an invocation. Remarks were delivered by Ambassador Jackson, Senior Defense Official U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel (LTC) Joseph Lee, and PFC Mensah\u2019s uncle Andrew Kwadwo Oduro.<\/p>\n<p>In his remarks, the Ambassador lauded PFC Mensah\u2019s heroism noting: <em><strong>\u201cWhen his apartment building in the Bronx, New York, caught on fire on December 28, 2017, Private First Class Mensah safely fled to the street. Once there, he realized that his neighbors were threatened by the fire and he did not hesitate to answer the call of his heart four times to bring them to safety and comfort. In doing so, he saved four lives. He performed these acts of heroism at the expense of his own life, which we honor here today\u2026 The story of America is written through the lives of citizens and immigrants like Emmanuel Mensah. Common men and women who become heroes by doing extraordinary things in pursuit of serving others. They place others \u2013 always &#8211; before self. Their lives are an inspiration to us all, and the threads by which the national character of the United States is perpetually woven\u2026 let us never forget that Private First Class Mensah\u2019s example calls on each of us to higher service for one another, our nations, and our world. Our common son gave his best, and so must we. May he rest in perfect peace and live forever in our hearts and memories, especially of those who loved and knew him.\u201d\u00a0<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>LTC Lee lauded PFC Mensah\u2019s heroism and embodiment of the highest standards of courage and selflessness of the profession of arms. Speaking for the family, his uncle Andrew Kwadwo Oduro expressed their pride, love, and admiration for PFC Mensah\u2019s courage in selflessly \u201cstanding up\u201d to face danger in order to save four lives. He reflected on PFC Mensah\u2019s life in Ghana, how much he meant to his family, his dreams of one day becoming a soldier, his determination to pursue an education, and perseverance towards attaining his goals. Their remarks were followed by a reading of the Soldier\u2019s Medal citation awarded by the President of the United States to PFC Mensah in honor and recognition of his heroism.<\/p>\n<p>The ceremony concluded with a benediction, final roll call, paying of last respects to PFC Mensah, and a reception for special guests hosted by the Ambassador.\u00a0Read the Ambassador\u2019s remarks below.<\/p>\n<p class=\"m_410594401847086933gmail-p1\" align=\"center\"><span class=\"m_410594401847086933gmail-s1\"><b>Memorial Ceremony for PFC Emmanuel Mensah<u><\/u><u><\/u><\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"m_410594401847086933gmail-p1\" align=\"center\"><span class=\"m_410594401847086933gmail-s1\"><b>Remarks by Ambassador Robert P.
