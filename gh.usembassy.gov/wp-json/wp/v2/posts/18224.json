Jackson<\/b><br \/>\n<b>Chief of Mission Residence<\/b><br \/>\n<b>Thursday, November 16, 2017 | 10 a.m.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">American Chamber of Commerce-Ghana President, Mr. Joe Mensah,<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">AMCHAM Board of Directors and member companies,<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Colleagues,<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Distinguished ladies and gentlemen,<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Akwaaba! \u00a0It\u2019s good to see all of you again. \u00a0Babs and I always enjoy hosting you in our home. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">merican businesses and investors have long been at the forefront of deepening ties between our two countries. \u00a0We appreciate the leadership of our American Chamber of Commerce in Ghana in advancing that partnership. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Much has happened since we met at Labadi Beach Hotel last November. \u00a0Ghana once again demonstrated its political maturity to the world, celebrating a free, fair, and transparent election and a peaceful transition of power. \u00a0Back home, we also welcomed a new administration with the election of President Trump. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With political change in both our countries, many people have asked me how that affects the work we do here in Ghana. \u00a0I am here to tell you today that America\u2019s commitment to Africa and to Ghana remains strong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In fact, less than three months ago, we hosted a Congressional delegation led by Senator Chris Coons from Delaware. \u00a0During that visit, our legislators expressed unequivocal bipartisan support for Africa. \u00a0Their presence here alone demonstrated their sincere interest in Ghana, and their desire to better understand Africa and its potential. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The United States continues to work toward making improvements in Ghana\u2019s power sector. \u00a0Senator Coons reiterated support for U.S. government initiatives like Power Africa \u2014 which will help make President Akufo-Addo\u2019s \u201cone district-one factory\u201d vision a reality, through the provision of reliable and affordable power. \u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Our Millennium Challenge Corporation Compact continues to move forward. \u00a0The Compact will provide $498 million to improve Ghana\u2019s power distribution. \u00a0The Government of Ghana convened the second bidder\u2019s conference here in Accra in early October. \u00a0Four potential concessionaires remain interested in the tender. \u00a0The successful bidder will invest an <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">additional <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">$500 million in the power distribution sector. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We look forward to the Millennium Development Authority issuing its final revised request for proposal this month. \u00a0The government will select the concessionaire in the spring of 2018, and the project must reach financial close by September of next year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Through Power Africa, we are also working closely with American companies General Electric and Endeavor to bring the Early\/Bridge Power project to financial close by December. \u00a0Once completed, this project will bring 400 megawatts of affordable and reliable gas power to Ghanaian homes and businesses. \u00a0It will also generate $90 million in U.S. exports.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Speaking of exports, the United States will continue to work with Ghana and other African countries to increase bilateral trade. \u00a0We want to sell more American products and services to the world! \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It is exciting to see that American companies are finding success in Ghana. \u00a0In June, we welcomed the opening of a new Pinkberry frozen yogurt franchise, not far from the embassy. \u00a0A second facility opened in East Legon a few weeks ago. \u00a0We also witnessed the expansion of Pizza Hut into a second location at Palace, even larger than its first storefront in the Accra Mall. \u00a0We eagerly anticipate the opening of the new Marriott hotel near the airport \u2014 in early 2018, we hope. \u00a0Major American companies like Motorola and Exxon-Mobil are also exploring the possibilities provided by the Ghanaian market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I have and will continue to advocate on behalf of your interests. \u00a0I want to see your businesses grow! \u00a0We definitely want to see more American jobs created back home, but we also want to see new jobs created for Ghanaians. \u00a0There is enough room for both our economies to grow and prosper. \u00a0As Under Secretary of State Tom Shannon said recently, \u201cThe Trump administration seeks to do business not just <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Africa, but <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">with<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Africa, moving the focus of our economic relationship \u2026 from aid to trade and investment.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We applaud President Akufo-Addo\u2019s focus on making Ghana a better place to do business. \u00a0Indeed, the government has taken important steps to improve business processes, lower taxes, and reform customs clearance processes. \u00a0We appreciate the positive steps already made, but we must continue our <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">joint<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> encouragement for the government to do more:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">to protect intellectual property,<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">to improve transparency in public procurement, <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">to honor contracts, <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">address land disputes, <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">enforce laws, and <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">to hold people accountable when they defraud the public and break those laws.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Moving beyond business, we will continue to build upon our substantial peace and security cooperation. \u00a0We are exploring even more ways to collaborate with the Government of Ghana to address security vulnerabilities, protect against the threat of terrorist activities, and support multiple peacekeeping operations. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">U.S. Africa Command is considering Ghana as a partner country for the West Africa Logistics Network. \u00a0This is a \u201cspoke and wheel\u201d approach to more efficiently answer logistics demands across Africa\u2019s vast distances. \u00a0We are also continuing negotiations for a more robust Defense Cooperation Agreement with Ghana. \u00a0Our militaries continue to partner in major exercises that greatly benefit both institutions. \u00a0In fact, during Exercise United Accord, Ghana became the first African nation to train U.S. Army troops, when more than 60 U.S. soldiers underwent the rigorous program at the Jungle Warfare School. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ghana has proven again and again its commitment to being a steadfast partner in regional and global security. \u00a0We value and reciprocate that commitment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Last but not least, I must address an issue that I know is a top priority for everyone in this room \u2014 VISAS! \u00a0The Embassy remains committed to facilitating legitimate travel to the United States. \u00a0Each year, we issue thousands of visas for Ghanaian businessmen and women, tourists, and students to travel to America. \u00a0My consular team has been working hard to ensure our visa adjudication process is lean and efficient. \u00a0I\u2019m proud to tell you that over the last three months, the average wait time for a visa appointment has fallen from more than three weeks to just a few days. \u00a0We will strive to keep our wait times under one week \u2014 a key service delivery standard that will promote business travel and trade. \u00a0We may not be able to approve every application, but every applicant will be treated with respect and professionalism while they are visiting our consular section. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In closing, I am reminded of the proverb that says, \u201cIf you want to go quickly, go alone. \u00a0If you want to go far, go together.\u201d \u00a0My commitment to you today is that my Embassy team and I will continue to walk in step with American businesses and the Ghanaian government. \u00a0We will go together, as we work to improve trade, create jobs, and make Ghana a place where companies can flourish.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thank you again for joining us in our home today. \u00a0I look forward to taking a few questions from the audience.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On Thursday November 16, 2017,\u00a0Ambassador Jackson hosted this year&#8217;s Annual General Meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce-Ghana.
