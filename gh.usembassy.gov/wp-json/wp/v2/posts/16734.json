The trafficking of Ghanaians, particularly children, within the country is more prevalent than the transnational trafficking of foreign migrants.<\/p>\n<p>Ghana was ranked Tier 2 in the 2014 <i>Trafficking in Persons (TIP)<\/i> <i>Report<\/i>, which is a ranking given to countries whose governments do not fully comply with the Trafficking Victims Protection Act\u2019s minimum standards, but are making significant efforts to bring themselves into compliance with those standards.\u00a0 Ghana&#8217;s ranking is based on numerous reports \u00a0that Ghanaian children are subject to forced labor in fishing, domestic service, street hawking, begging, portering, mining, and agriculture.\u00a0 Ghanaian girls, and to a lesser extent boys, are subjected to prostitution within Ghana, including in oil-producing regions and around Lake Volta.\u00a0Key ministries responsible for enforcing Ghana\u2019s anti-trafficking laws and protecting child trafficking victims did not receive adequate funding to fulfill their responsibilities.<\/p>\n<p>Despite these challenges, Ghana has made progress on human trafficking issues.\u00a0 In August 2014, the Ministry of Gender reconstituted and convened the Human Trafficking Management Board, which had not met for more than a year.\u00a0 We hope that this will lead to increased coordination among stakeholders moving forward. \u00a0We also hope to see the final Parliamentary approval and full implementation of the Human Trafficking Act\u2019s Legislative Instrument.<\/p>\n<p>The Department of State funds an extensive array of projects and programs around the world aimed at combating human trafficking. These projects tackle corruption, train prosecutors and law enforcement, provide support for victims, and raise awareness.\u00a0 As of October 2014, the Trafficking in Persons Office oversees 98 projects worth nearly $60 million in 71 countries around the world.<\/p>\n<p>I am happy to announce an exciting new proposal that the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons has initiated with Ghana.\u00a0 The Office is working to negotiate the first Child Protection Compact (CPC) Partnership, to be developed and implemented jointly with the government of Ghana.\u00a0 I\u2019m very excited about the potential CPC Partnership, which would be a five-year, $5 million innovative effort to combat child trafficking,<\/p>\n<p>The creation of this Compact will further enhance and enrich the broad spectrum of partnership the US enjoys with Ghana.\u00a0 Having the opportunity to improve the lives of Ghana\u2019s most vulnerable children will now become an important focus of our trafficking in persons efforts with Ghana. \u00a0In order to address this important issue comprehensively, there is need for contribution and collaboration from a wide range of stakeholders.\u00a0 When we work in conformity with internationally recognized norms and processes and tighten legislative loopholes the needs of vulnerable children are also served.\u00a0 We commend the Cabinet of the Government of Ghana for their recent approval of a memoranda for the ratification of The Hague 1993 Convention on Inter-Country Adoptions; Amendment of the Children\u2019s Act; and Child and Family Welfare Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Ghana\u2019s selection was based in part on evidence<b> <\/b>of your government&#8217;s commitment to partner with the United States and the strength of the NGOs and international organizations working to combat modern slavery in Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>This week the Embassy has hosted two officials from the Trafficking in Persons Office, Laura Rundlet and Jane Sigmon, who met with government officials, NGOs, and other stakeholders\u2014including many of you in this room\u2014 to start exploring a CPC Partnership.\u00a0 We appreciate your cooperation as we craft this exciting and important partnership.<\/p>\n<p>The fight against modern slavery is a priority for the U.S. government and we are pleased that an organization with IJM\u2019s caliber will be joining the ranks of the great NGOs that we already have here in Ghana.\u00a0 I look forward to watching your organization grow and I wish you all the best.<\/p>\n<p>To all of the anti-trafficking activists here this evening, please know that the U.S. government is your partner in this fight.\u00a0 Do not hesitate to call on us, as we are dedicated to furthering the guarantees of freedom from slavery and involuntary servitude.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good afternoon, Deputy Minister John Alexander Ackon, distinguished guests and all protocols observed. \u00a0It is a pleasure to be with you this evening for the grand launching of International Justice Mission\u2019s 18th Field Office.
