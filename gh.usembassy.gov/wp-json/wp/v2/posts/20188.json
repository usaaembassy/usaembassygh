Thirty-five percent.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">According to the United Nations, that is the percentage of women worldwide who say they have experienced physical and\/or sexual intimate partner violence, or, sexual violence by a non-partner.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With approximately 50 people present this afternoon, that would be almost 18 people in this room alone who actually self-reported such incidents.\u00a0 Many more such crimes go unreported. Violence against women is as serious a cause of death and incapacity among women of reproductive age as cancer, and a greater cause of ill health than traffic accidents and malaria combined. While there has been recent progress, these statistics are stark reminders of the work still to be done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Today is the beginning of the annual 16-Days of Activism Against Gender-based Violence Campaign.\u00a0 It is heartening to be in this room full of advocates, subject matter experts, journalists, survivors, and family members or friends of survivors.\u00a0 All of us are here to acknowledge and address the issue of gender-based violence.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thank you for joining us.\u00a0 And thank you, Florence, for hosting us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This year, the 16-Days of Activism theme is \u201cOrange the World:\u00a0 Generational Equality Stands Against Rape.\u201d This morning, on my way to work, I observed peaceful women bearing signs with orange lettering supporting this cause.\u00a0 This campaign is a call to action to the young and not so young \u2013 boys, girls, men, and women \u2013 to take an active stand against rape. Not just the abhorrent action of rape but also the worldwide culture that fosters and tacitly condones it.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A culture that does not believe at its core that women and men should be treated as equals with the same rights and opportunities.\u00a0 The conspiracy of silence around sexual and gender-based violence robs survivors of their power and inhibits socio-economic development.\u00a0 We must use the power of strong support networks and speak up in order to bring about accountability and change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To kick off this year\u2019s 16-Days of Activism, we are here today to launch Mobile Web Ghana\u2019s \u201cVisuals for Gender\u201d Project.\u00a0 Funded through a U.S. Embassy grant, \u201cVisuals for Gender\u201d aims to build the capacity of journalists, gender activists, CSOs, and government agencies working on sexual and reproductive health to tell the complete story with data.\u00a0 Often, cases of gender-based violence are reported as single, isolated cases.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Data help connect those dots to create an evidence-based case that shines a light on this worldwide epidemic. This epidemic affects our most vulnerable \u2013 our girls.\u00a0 We saw in the videos the importance awareness-building activities for school-aged children and their educators alike. As a former teacher, I know first-hand how important safe space is for learning.\u00a0 The \u201cVisuals for Gender\u201d team\u2019s Aim to educate 300 junior and senior high school girls and 50 teachers is timely.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">On the observance of this year\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, \u201cIn far too many places, women and girls still do not enjoy basic rights and are prevented from taking their rightful place in society. We strive for a world in which women and girls are free to realize their full potential and live in dignity along with their families, communities, and countries.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The U.S. Embassy places a priority on such programming and is honored to promote these \u201csafe spaces.\u201d\u00a0 We provide a platform for programs in which advocates, social workers, and law enforcement specialists meet with survivors of gender-based violence and with audiences who are the most vulnerable: adolescent girls.\u00a0 We rely on a network of women leaders to facilitate these sessions.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Over time, this group has become the Woke Women Task Force that includes health experts, social workers, psychologists, and female police officers, some of whom are alumnae of USG exchange programs.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In fact, members of the Woke Women Task Force played a key role in creating this \u201cVisuals for Gender\u201d project.\u00a0 Leading the charge is Mandela Washington Fellow alumna and Founder\/CEO of Mobile Web Ghana, Florence Toffa. I think Florence and her team deserve a round of applause for all the hard work they have done, and will continue to do, to address the pervasiveness of gender-based violence. Programs like \u201cVisuals for Gender\u201d start, build, and nurture the necessary support networks for our women and girls and build the case for change\u2026 change that in the year 2019, is long overdue!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In closing, I\u2019d like to share my hope that the momentum built during these next 16 days extends well beyond the campaign, in order to increase safe spaces for our girls, strengthen support networks, keep the conversations going, and continue making progress.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thank you. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Visuals for Gender Launch Ceremony Remarks by U.S. Ambassador to Ghana Stephanie S.
