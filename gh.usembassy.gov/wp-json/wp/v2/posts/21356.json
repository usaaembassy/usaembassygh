The new facilities are part of a U.S. Government effort to partner with communities, companies, and non-profit organizations in West Africa to expand economic opportunities for women.\u00a0 The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) developed the facilities in partnership with the Global Shea Alliance (GSA) and Evolution of Smooth, a U.S. cosmetics brand.\u00a0 The facilities will increase incomes for 1,000 Ghanaian women who collect and process shea nuts. The project was also supported by two NGOs, A Rocha Ghana and No\u00e9, both focused on the sustainable management of environmental resources.<\/p>\n<p>U.S. Ambassador to Ghana Stephanie S. Sullivan applauded the project\u2019s partners, stating, \u201cThese shea processing facilities directly support women with safe working environments.\u00a0 Providing them with productive tools and ongoing skills training shows our commitment to partnerships that lead toward economic empowerment and self-reliance.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Shea is a primary source of livelihood for women living in northern Ghana and is one of the few agricultural crops where women control their revenue. \u00a0This project affirms the U.S. Government\u2019s commitment to promote women&#8217;s economic empowerment through partnerships that connect Ghanaian women producers with U.S. buyers.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUSAID is working with the Global Shea Alliance, communities, non-profit organizations, and responsible companies, who together since 2016 have provided 219 warehouses, generating increased incomes for more than 189,020 women across West Africa,\u201d Ambassador Sullivan noted.<\/p>\n<p>The Global Shea Alliance\u2019s Sustainable Shea Initiative was launched in 2016 in partnership with USAID.\u00a0 The $18 million, five-year program promotes the sustainable expansion of the shea industry in Ghana, Benin, Ivory Coast, Togo, Mali, Nigeria, and Burkina Faso. The partnership matches USAID funds with private sector and development partner funds to provide needed skills training and infrastructure to support women shea collectors.<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\">###<\/p>\n<p><b><i>\u00a0<\/i><\/b><b><i>About USAID\/West Africa:\u00a0\u00a0<\/i><\/b>The USAID\/West Africa regional mission\u2019s goal is to promote social and economic well-being advanced by West Africans.\u00a0 The American people, through USAID, provide economic and humanitarian assistance in more than 100 countries worldwide aimed at promoting a path to recipient self-reliance and resilience.\u00a0 For more information please visit\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com\/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usaid.gov%2Fwest-africa-regional&amp;data=04%7C01%7CAhiatiC%40state.gov%7C426028b201864f39bb4808d8ce6ff353%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C637486327562501398%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=sCGmYqTk7TUaJpH9OJu%2Fd%2BRKlxNrZydWJ3mzkIGUpRg%3D&amp;reserved=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com\/?url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.usaid.gov%252Fwest-africa-regional%26data%3D04%257C01%257CAhiatiC%2540state.gov%257C426028b201864f39bb4808d8ce6ff353%257C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%257C0%257C0%257C637486327562501398%257CUnknown%257CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%253D%257C1000%26sdata%3DsCGmYqTk7TUaJpH9OJu%252Fd%252BRKlxNrZydWJ3mzkIGUpRg%253D%26reserved%3D0&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1613123797645000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEfwmD36XdU2QR6pb3Qv-XLpAyZ8w\">https:\/\/www.usaid.gov\/west-africa-regional<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Murugu, Savannah Region, GHANA\u2014 On Thursday, January 28, 2021, ownership of the A Rocha Ghana shea butter processing facility and eight warehouses was transferred to nine shea cooperatives in the West Gonja District in the Savannah Region of northern Ghana.
