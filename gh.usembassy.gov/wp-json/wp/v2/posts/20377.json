Sullivan inaugurated a shea butter processing facility and warehouse for the Tiyumtaba Women\u2019s Shea Cooperative of Sorogu, located in the Sagnerigu Municipality in the Northern Region of Ghana. The new facility, is part of a U.S. Government effort to partner with communities, companies, and non-profit organizations in West Africa to expand economic opportunities for women.\u00a0 The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) developed the facility in partnership with the Burt\u2019s Bees brand, owned by American manufacturer, The Clorox Company, and the Ghanaian firm Savannah Fruits Company; the facility will increase incomes for 600 Ghanaian women who collect and process shea nuts.<\/p>\n<p>Ambassador Sullivan applauded the project partners, stating, \u201cThe opening of this shea processing and warehouse facility is an important accomplishment that demonstrates what is possible to achieve when we all work together.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Shea is a primary source of livelihood for women living in northern Ghana and is one of the few agricultural crops where women control their revenue.\u00a0 This project affirms the U.S. Government\u2019s commitment to promote women&#8217;s economic empowerment through partnerships that connect Ghanaian women producers with U.S. buyers.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUSAID is working with the Global Shea Alliance, communities, non-profit organizations, and responsible companies, who together since 2016 have provided 250 warehouses, generating increased incomes for more than 137,000 women across West Africa,\u201d Ambassador Sullivan noted.<\/p>\n<p>The Global Shea Alliance\u2019s Sustainable Shea Initiative was launched in 2016 in partnership with USAID.\u00a0 The $18 million, five-year program promotes the sustainable expansion of the shea industry in Ghana, Benin, Ivory Coast, Togo, Mali, Nigeria, and Burkina Faso. The partnership matches USAID funds with private sector and development partner funds to provide needed skills training and infrastructure to support women shea collectors.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">###<\/p>\n<p>The USAID\/West Africa regional mission\u2019s goal is to promote social and economic well-being advanced by West Africans.\u00a0 Spanning 21 countries, USAID\/West Africa designs and implements programs with West African partners to strengthen systems of non-violent conflict management, support economic growth, and expand quality health services. \u00a0The American people, through USAID, provide economic and humanitarian assistance in more than 100 countries worldwide aimed at promoting a path to recipient self-reliance and resilience. \u00a0For more information please visit <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usaid.gov\/west-africa-regional\">https:\/\/www.usaid.gov\/west-africa-regional<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sorogu, Northern Region, GHANA\u2014 On Wednesday, February 5, 2020, U.S. Ambassador Stephanie S.
