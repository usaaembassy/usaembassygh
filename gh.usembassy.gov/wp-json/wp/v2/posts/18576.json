Jackson<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>University of Cape Coast<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Friday, March 23, 2018 | 11:30 a.m. \u2013 12:30 p.m.<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Thank you all for your warm welcome.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>My wife, Babs, and I are honored to be here at the University of Cape Coast.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I often talk about the fact that our relationship with Ghana is strong, and that it goes back long before Ghana\u2019s independence 61 years ago.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>We cannot ignore the fact that our connection with Ghana began here, at one of the lowest points in history, when so many journeyed against their will to the Americas \u2014 victims of the brutal slave trade.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>We are still dealing with the repercussions of that injustice, but the spirit of those ancestors lives on in the United States.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Their voices and their resilience are woven into the heritage and the fabric of the country I serve.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>They shaped who we are as a nation and influenced generations of leaders, from Harriet Tubman to Martin Luther King, Jr. to Barack and Michelle Obama.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Today I want to speak with you about that relationship between Ghana and the United States \u2014 and about the work we do at the U.S. Embassy in Accra.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Most of all, I want to talk about how it affects you, as the future leaders of Ghana.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>We\u2019ll have time for questions at the end, and I look forward to hearing from you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">First, I would like to share a little about me, which you may not know.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Before I became a diplomat, I taught English and American Civilization at a French university.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>I feel at home any time I\u2019m meeting with students at university campuses.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>There\u2019s so much energy and enthusiasm.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>You\u2019re the ones who will lead this nation, this continent and, indeed, our world.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>I hope you feel that excitement, and I hope you never lose it.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Ten, twenty, thirty years from now, keep that passion \u2014 to tackle challenges; to fight corruption; to create jobs; to empower <i>all<\/i> Ghanaians to reach their potential. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Babs and I have called Ghana home for more than two years now.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>However, this is not the first African country we have come to know and love.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>I have focused on Africa throughout my diplomatic career, and we have made our home in seven African countries, from Morocco all the way to Zimbabwe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The friendship between the Republic of Ghana and the United States is well established.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>American diplomats were posted here before Ghana\u2019s independence.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>In 1957, we elevated our consulate in Accra to a full embassy.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Today, hundreds of people\u2014Americans <i>and <\/i>Ghanaians\u2014work at our embassy, focusing every day on how we can further strengthen our bilateral relationship. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">As young people, you know well that Ghana has tremendous promise.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>President Akufo-Addo has established a bold vision for the future \u2014 a future where all Ghanaians live in dignity and are able to provide for themselves, their families, and their communities \u2014 a future where the government can provide for its citizens.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>It is, as the President stated, a vision of \u201cGhana Beyond Aid.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The United States fully supports this vision, and our work here helps Ghana make concrete steps toward achieving that feat.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Specifically, our work centers on the following four areas of mutual concern:<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> 1. Economic growth;<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> 2. Health and education;<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> 3. Peace and security; and<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> 4. Good governance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Now, obviously, if we\u2019re going to achieve \u201cGhana Beyond Aid,\u201d we need economic growth and prosperity for all Ghanaians.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>After suffering in recent years due to factors such as declining prices for cocoa, gold, and oil, Ghana\u2019s economy has rebounded last year and this year.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>There\u2019s promise here, and President Akufo-Addo has been very outspoken about wanting Ghana to be the most business-friendly country in Africa.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>That\u2019s an ambitious, admirable and achievable goal.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>We\u2019re working together with the government, as well as with entrepreneurs, NGOs, and communities to make that happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Why does this matter to you?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Well, like young people all around the world, you may wonder what you\u2019ll do for work after you finish your degree.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>There are far more graduates than there are jobs.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>This, understandably, causes concern and anxiety for students\u2014and their parents.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>We\u2019re concerned about that, too.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>That is why we want to help create that environment in which Ghanaian businesses will thrive.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>A climate in which <b>you<\/b> can establish a business and thrive.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>You can be the one who creates new jobs \u2014 providing not just incomes, but dignity, that will sustain families and communities. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Part of our efforts includes developing a strong and efficient power sector through the U.S. government\u2019s Power Africa Initiative.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Unreliable and inadequate power stifles economic growth.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>In fact, economic research shows that Ghana\u2019s economy lost more than $24 billion between 2010 and 2016, as a result of dumsor.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>If your business can\u2019t operate due to lack of electricity, you can\u2019t make a profit.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>If you have no profit, well, that\u2019s the end of your business\u2014and your employees\u2019 incomes, as well.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">With the second Millennium Challenge Compact, we\u2019re investing $498 million to transform the power sector.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>There\u2019s a lot of misinformation out there about the Compact, perpetuated by people who profit from the status quo.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>So let me be clear:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>ECG will still be owned by you, the people of Ghana.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>The goal is to transform ECG so that it can serve as a reliable and affordable source of power for you.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>We believe that with proper management, ECG will grow, necessitating <i>more<\/i> employees, not fewer.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>I have said it many times and will continue to say it:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>I absolutely believe this Compact is good for Ghana.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">We also want to expand trade and investment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">Diversifying Ghana\u2019s exports beyond cocoa, gold, and oil is good for Ghana.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>How many of you have heard of AGOA?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>It\u2019s an American law called the African Growth and Opportunity Act.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Under this law, more than 6,000 goods from select African countries, including many Made in Ghana products, can be exported to the United States duty free \u2014 and our customs experts regularly visit Ghana to ensure exporters know what goods qualify as duty free.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Working with the Ministry of Trade and Industry, we have identified a dozen products with great potential in the U.S. market.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>These include cashew, shea butter, handicrafts, gold jewelry, and garments.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>In fact, we have seen dramatic growth in apparel exports, which increased from approximately $500,000 in 2010 to $8.5 million in 2017.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>That number is expected to double again over the next two years.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>New Ghanaian exports such as frozen orange juice and dried mango are also increasing.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Last year, overall, Ghana\u2019s non-oil AGOA exports <\/span><span class=\"s1\">to the United States <\/span><span class=\"s3\"><b>doubled<\/b><\/span><span class=\"s1\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Developing the manufacturing sector is good for Ghana.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>In fact, those two things are essential for Ghana!<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>And what\u2019s good for Ghana is also good for the United States.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>An economically independent Ghana that is thriving and creating new jobs for its citizens maintains regional stability and is in America\u2019s national security interest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">American brands and franchises are rapidly expanding to new markets all over the world \u2014 fueling job growth at home and overseas.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>As the gateway to Africa, Ghana plays a key role for U.S. companies developing their presence on the continent.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Kentucky Fried Chicken, Hertz and Avis have been operating in Ghana for years.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Since I arrived in Ghana in January 2016, I have witnessed other American franchises opening their doors to the Ghanaian market, including Pizza Hut, Pinkberry, Counter Burger, and Steak Escape.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Uber now employs more than 3,000 drivers in Accra and more in Kumasi.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>ExxonMobil, the American oil and gas leader, recently signed an agreement with the Government of Ghana to begin exploration and production off the coast, not too terribly far from here.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>It will take some time, maybe three to five years, for Exxon to potentially make an oil discovery and begin production.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>But we are optimistic about the long-term economic benefits of Exxon\u2019s presence.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>More American firms are on the way.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>These investments create employment opportunities for Ghanaians and help stimulate economic growth and development.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">When the United States and Ghana work together to improve the economic environment, you benefit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">So, let\u2019s say you\u2019re one of the entrepreneurs in this room.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>You\u2019ve now graduated and you\u2019ve started your own business.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>You have reliable electricity, thanks to the Power Compact.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>What else do you need?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>You need a healthy, educated workforce.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>That\u2019s why we support government initiatives to combat malaria; improve nutrition and maternal and child health; and address HIV and AIDS.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>That\u2019s why we inaugurated eight Community-based Health Planning and Services Compounds and are constructing 18 more.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>They bring health services closer to you, so you can make the most productive use of your time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">Our <i>Partnership for Education <\/i>programs support the Ministry of Education and the Ghana Education Service as they promote reading and literacy among primary students \u2014 both in and out of the classroom.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Over the last two years we have <\/span><span class=\"s1\">provided public primary schools with approximately five <i>million<\/i> books and teacher training aids to help children learn to read in 11 indigenous languages and English<\/span><span class=\"s2\">, and we have trained over <\/span><span class=\"s1\">30,000 Ghanaian primary school teachers, head teachers, and curriculum leads in phonics and reading.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>We a<\/span><span class=\"s2\">re also helping Ghana expand access to education for adolescent girls, because we know that when girls are educated, societies are transformed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">And even if you haven\u2019t started your own business:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>when you get a job after graduation, you want healthy, educated co-workers, right?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Trust me, you will want colleagues who can pitch in side-by-side with you and help your organization thrive. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\u2026 So we can see how economic growth, health and education are tied together.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Let\u2019s add peace and security to that mix.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Instability kills economies and threatens global security far beyond any one country\u2019s borders. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I suspect you have questions about this aspect of our bilateral relationship, so let me be clear:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>There\u2019s a lot of misinformation out there that misrepresents the partnership we have with Ghana \u2014 and it truly is a partnership.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>When I visited Elmina Castle this morning, I was reminded of the agreements that Ghanaians entered into with the Portuguese, Dutch, and British prior to Ghana\u2019s independence.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>The proposed Defense Cooperation Agreement is not that kind of one-sided agreement.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Ghanaians and Americans both stand to benefit from this accord.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Ghana is noteworthy for the way it maintains peace and stability within its borders.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Ghana is also well respected for the way it advances peace on the continent, and around the world, through participation in peacekeeping operations.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>The international community faces countless security threats, and Ghana\u2019s ability to contribute to countering those threats is invaluable.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">For more than 20 years, we have had ongoing coordination and training exercises with the Ghana Armed Forces and with law enforcement.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Sometimes U.S. military personnel come to Ghana.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Sometimes Ghanaian security personnel go to the United States or other locations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">This training is designed to help Ghana\u2019s security forces tackle the global issues that could impact your daily life and threaten Ghana\u2019s development:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>issues like crime, terrorism, trafficking in persons and narcotics, border security, maritime security, and even cyber security.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I said it truly is a partnership, and it is.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Here\u2019s one example:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Last year, the Ghana Armed Forces became the first African force to train U.S. Army forces.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>U.S. soldiers participated in training at your Jungle Warfare School, under the leadership of your armed forces.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>If you haven\u2019t seen the reporting on this, I highly recommend that you check out the videos online.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>U.S. armed forces described the training as eye-opening, demanding, and grueling \u2026 but also as important, memorable, and critical to our ability to work <i>alongside<\/i> the Ghana Armed Forces to counter global threats. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">These are U.S. soldiers who are now better able to defend the United States <i>and our allies<\/i> because of training they received <i>here<\/i>.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>That\u2019s the partnership we want with Ghana.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Let me also be clear that when U.S. military personnel come to Ghana temporarily to lead or receive training; that is exactly what they do:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>They come to Ghana.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>They lead or receive training alongside the Ghana Armed Forces.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>And then they leave.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>There is no U.S. military base.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>We have not requested a U.S. military base.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Within the Embassy, we have our own detachment of Marine Security Guards, and a handful of Department of Defense personnel who manage our relationship with Ghana\u2019s Ministry of Defense.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I absolutely agree with those who are say that Ghana is a strong, sovereign nation.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>That\u2019s exactly why we\u2019re renewing our agreement with the Government of Ghana.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Ghana has shown that it has the capability to be an anchor of stability in the region and a significant contributor to global security.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>The provisions in the Defense Cooperation Agreement mirror the agreements we have with other key security partners, such as Germany, Japan, South Korea and Senegal.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Let me be clear:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>We are asking Ghana to partner with us in the same way we partner with our allies in Europe, Asia, and around the world.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>We want to work more closely with you, because together, we are stronger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">And that brings me to the final focus of our partnership with Ghana:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>good governance.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>I have <i>not <\/i>placed it last because it\u2019s the least important.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>On the contrary:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>I\u2019ve saved it for last because I am absolutely convinced that \u201cGhana Beyond Aid\u201d cannot happen without good governance \u2026 <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">And that brings me to the final focus of our partnership with Ghana:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>good governance.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>I have <i>not <\/i>placed it last because it\u2019s the least important.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>On the contrary:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>I\u2019ve saved it for last because I am absolutely convinced that \u201cGhana Beyond Aid\u201d cannot happen without good governance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Now, part of good governance is \u2026 just that:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>improving the ability of the government to provide services to citizens at the national and local level, strengthening institutions, and holding government accountable.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>We\u2019re partnering with the government on programs that help MDAs better manage their budgets and keep citizens better informed.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>You can promote good governance by advocating for passage of the Right to Information bill, the ability of Members of Parliament to introduce legislation, the creation and implementation of a meaningful asset declaration system, and direct elections for District and Municipal Chief Executives \u2014 a change that will bring greater accountability and help government respond more nimbly to citizens at the local level. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">But true good governance goes beyond that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cGhana Beyond Aid\u201dis a bold vision.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>To achieve it, we must be equally bold about eliminating the injustices that inhibit development.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>We <i>must <\/i>eradicate trafficking in persons.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>We <i>must<\/i> ensure women have equal rights and girls have equal access to education.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>And we <i>must <\/i>pledge that we will tirelessly fight against corruption \u2014 in all its forms, wherever it is found.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">To be clear, these are not Ghana-specific problems.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Injustice exists everywhere.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>That\u2019s why it\u2019s even more effective when we come together and demonstrate our <i>shared<\/i> responsibility for addressing the issues we face.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Pervasive corruption has a direct impact on some of the areas that are most critical to Ghana\u2019s growth and development.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Corruption is <b>not<\/b> a victimless crime.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>It steals directly from the pockets of citizens.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Corruption steals from you.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>We talked about investment earlier.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Corruption stymies investment and inhibits free enterprise.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Would you want to start a business or invest in a company if you knew you had to throw away your hard-earned money on bribes?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>No one does.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Corruption compromises the quality and availability of much-needed services like healthcare, education, and infrastructure development.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>When you have to pay a bribe for a doctor to check on your hospitalized relative, corruption threatens <i>lives<\/i>.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Whether through bribery, embezzlement, nepotism, or in some other form, corruption eats away at the livelihoods of ordinary people.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>It eats away at your opportunities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Another injustice that will prevent Ghana from reaching its full potential is trafficking in persons.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>This is an issue that is close to my heart.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>We <i>must<\/i> do more to fight trafficking in persons.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>It is modern-day slavery.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Men, women and children are held against their will in humiliating, harmful, crushing slave labor.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>We were all outraged by the images of Africans being sold in Libya, but what about the children who are sold here in Ghana for 100 cedis and are now forced to work day and night in harsh \u2014 and even dangerous \u2014 conditions?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>What about the 11-year-old who is forced to cook, clean and serve, rather than read, learn and play?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>I have traveled to fishing villages in the Volta Region and have seen children working on boats \u2014 in the middle of the day, when they should be in school.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>I have seen how the illegal mining industry uses children.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Children who should be in school.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">You have completed your basic and secondary education.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Now you\u2019re at university, getting further education so that you may contribute to Ghana\u2019s development.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Other Ghanaian children, at the very least, must have the same opportunity to complete their secondary education.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>The more educated citizens are, the more likely they are to be integrated into the economy and to participate in democracy \u2014 just the kind of citizenry needed to move Ghana beyond aid. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">As I said earlier, this is not a Ghana-specific problem.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Trafficking exists in every country, including the United States.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>That\u2019s why we must work together to ensure <i>all <\/i>men, women and children can pursue their dreams as productive members of their communities.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>We must ensure that those who profit from exploiting ordinary people in this manner are arrested, prosecuted, convicted, and punished.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>We have ongoing programs with local communities, law enforcement and the judiciary to help identify and rescue victims and capture and punish perpetrators. I challenge you to recognize the warning signs of trafficking and enslavement, and speak up if you see something.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Together, we must be relentless in our efforts to promote good governance and human rights for all citizens \u2014 not just some citizens.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Every person deserves a chance to succeed in life.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">So I\u2019ve talked about what we do and what it means for you.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>To end, I want to address \u201cWhy.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Why does the United States care about what happens in Ghana?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>It\u2019s pretty simple, really.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Just decades ago, the distance between us seemed so much bigger.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>It took months to sail across the Atlantic.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Then propeller aircraft brought us closer \u2014 but not close enough.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>You still had to connect through Europe.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Now, you can get on a plane in Accra and arrive in New York or Washington, D.C. 10 hours later \u2014 and vice versa.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">People and goods travel back and forth daily.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Last year, the U.S. Embassy in Accra issued visas to more than 20,000 Ghanaians for travel to the United States.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>We communicate instantly via Skype or Facetime.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>We are all connected in ways that seemed unimaginable just 10 years ago.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Because of that, when Ghana succeeds, you anchor stability throughout the region.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>That stability contributes to global security.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>When Ghana succeeds, you can export your high-quality products to the United States \u2014 and your citizens have the disposable income to purchase American goods.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>When Ghana succeeds, your citizens can work with our citizens to tackle the global issues that threaten peace, health and prosperity.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Success is not a zero-sum game.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>We can all win.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">You are the next generation that will take on the task of developing Ghana and shaping this more peaceful, more prosperous, more democratic world we all want.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>We want to play a role in equipping you to be great leaders.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Let me tell you how. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">One way in which we want to engage with all of you is through the Young African Leaders Initiative, which you might know as YALI.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>We just concluded the selection of our fifth cohort of YALI Mandela Washington Fellows.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>They will travel to the United States for six weeks of leadership training.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Working with the private sector, we have also expanded the opportunities for young people to receive leadership training here at home.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Four YALI Regional Leadership Centers \u2014 including one in Accra \u2014bring together young leaders according to sub-region.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>But improving your leadership capability can be as simple as joining the YALI Network, a virtual community that links hundreds of thousands of young people across the continent and offers free online courses on the topics that matter most to you.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Education is critical to our mutual success, and your education is the greatest investment you will ever make.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>If you want to explore opportunities to study in America, we have EducationUSA Centers in Accra and in Kumasi that advise students looking at the United States for their next degree.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>In fact, there are more than 3,100 Ghanaian students enrolled at colleges and universities in the United States, and our institutions are looking to recruit more.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>If you\u2019re interested in learning more about these programs and about our work, please check out our website and follow the embassy on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Thank you for your attention today.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>I will be happy to take your questions.<span
