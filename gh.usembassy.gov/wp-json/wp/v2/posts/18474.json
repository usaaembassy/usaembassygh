Du Bois, Mr. Arthur McFarlane,<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">President of the African American Association of Ghana, Madam Theresa Kwakye<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Director of the Du Bois Centre, Mr. B.S. Keelson<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Colleagues,<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen,<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Good morning. \u00a0There\u2019s an old saying, \u201cwe stand on the shoulders of giants.\u201d \u00a0The phrase describes how we have achieved progress by building on the work of those who came before us. \u00a0We still have much progress to make in America, in race relations, and beyond. \u00a0But much of the progress we <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">have<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> made ties back to thought leaders like Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To say that Du Bois\u2019 thinking was ahead of its time is a vast understatement. \u00a0He was one of the greatest scholars in American history during his <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">70-<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">year career. \u00a0That\u2019s seven zero.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Today, however, I want to shift away from discussing his thinking. \u00a0Instead, I\u2019d like to focus on his beliefs. \u00a0His beliefs about Africa. \u00a0Du Bois loved Africa. \u00a0He loved Ghana. \u00a0And he loved Accra so much so that he traveled here at the age of 93 and so much so that this country became his final resting place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He wrote a poem after arriving at this peaceful, leafy green place where we stand today a poem entitled \u201cGhana Calls,\u201d which he dedicated to Kwame Nkrumah. \u00a0I\u2019ll skip to the latter part of his poem, which reads:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I came to Accra. \u00a0<\/span><\/i><br \/>\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Here at last, I looked back on my Dream;\u00a0<\/span><\/i><br \/>\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I heard the Voice that loosed\u00a0<\/span><\/i><br \/>\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Long-looked dungeons of my soul\u00a0<\/span><\/i><br \/>\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I sensed that Africa had come\u00a0<\/span><\/i><br \/>\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Not up from Hell, but from the sum of Heaven\u2019s glory.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Africa had come \u201cfrom the sum of Heaven\u2019s glory.\u201d \u00a0<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is how Du Bois saw Africa. \u00a0And he told the world what he felt, through his words and his actions. \u00a0At that time, it wasn\u2019t easy to travel from one continent to another. \u00a0But through his work, Du Bois and his wife had traveled the globe. \u00a0They were able to come and witness the glory of this land in person. \u00a0They were able to share it with ordinary Americans most of whom would never have a chance to travel here. \u00a0They were able to share it with African Americans who could trace their ancestry to this very land. \u00a0The land that had come &#8220;from the sum of Heaven\u2019s glory.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dr. Du Bois passed away on the eve of the historic 1963 March on Washington, the same march at which Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered his famous \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech. \u00a0A crowd of more than 200,000 demonstrators had gathered in Washington on that clear, sunny day. \u00a0They heard over a loudspeaker about the passing of Dr. Du Bois half a world away, in a land that he loved. \u00a0It was a reminder that in their fight for equality and justice they, too, were standing on the shoulders of giants &#8212; Giants like W.E.B. Du Bois.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;I sensed that Africa had come &#8230; from the sum of Heaven&#8217;s glory.&#8221; Ambassador Jackson drew on the poetic words of W.E.B.
