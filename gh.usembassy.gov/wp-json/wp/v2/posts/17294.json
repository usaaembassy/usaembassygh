\u00a0Well, you may wonder what you will do for work after you finish your degree. \u00a0There are often far more graduates than there are jobs available. \u00a0This reality understandably causes concern and anxiety for students \u2014 and their parents. \u00a0We\u2019re concerned about that, too. \u00a0That is why we want to help create that environment in which Ghanaian businesses will thrive.<\/p>\n<p>Part of that effort includes strengthening the electrical power supply through our Power Africa Initiative. \u00a0Unreliable and inadequate power stifles economic growth. \u00a0If your business cannot operate due to lack of electricity, you cannot make a profit. \u00a0If you have no profit, well, that\u2019s the end of your business \u2014 and your employees\u2019 incomes, as well. \u00a0With the second Millennium Challenge compact, we\u2019re investing $498 million to transform the power sector. \u00a0We want to be part of the solution to \u201cdumsor dumsor.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>We also want to expand trade and investment. \u00a0I would love for Americans to discover more Ghanaian products in their local stores: \u00a0shea butter, shoes, textiles, cars, the list can go on and on. \u00a0The African Growth and Opportunity Act opens American doors by providing duty-free treatment to imports from Ghana. \u00a0Meanwhile, USAID\u2019s West Africa Trade Hub and the Feed the Future program are increasing regional trade in agricultural products to improve food security.<\/p>\n<p>I said we want to help create the environment in which businesses will thrive. \u00a0Let\u2019s take that one step further: \u00a0We want to help create the environment in which your business will thrive. \u00a0Ghanaians are already known for their entrepreneurial spirit. \u00a0I want to ensure we encourage students to think creatively and to seek out technological solutions to the challenges facing our world. \u00a0So consider how you might be able to take advantage of an improved economic environment to create employment for yourself and others.<\/p>\n<p>Now say you do start that business. \u00a0You need a healthy, educated workforce. \u00a0That\u2019s why we support government initiatives to curb malaria; improve nutrition; control HIV and AIDS. That is why we constructing hospitals and clinics. \u00a0Our Partnership for Education: Learning program supports the Ministry of Education and the Ghana Education Service as they promote reading and literacy among primary students. \u00a0Through the \u201cLet Girls Learn\u201d program we\u2019re helping Ghana expand access to education for adolescent girls, because we know that when girls are educated, societies are transformed.<\/p>\n<p>So we can see how economic growth, health and education are tied together. \u00a0Add peace and security to that mix. \u00a0Ghana is noteworthy for the way it maintains peace and stability within its borders, and also advances peace on the continent and beyond through contributions to peacekeeping operations. \u00a0The international community faces countless security threats, and Ghana\u2019s ability to contribute to countering those threats is invaluable. \u00a0The United States has ongoing training and coordination with the Ghanaian Armed Forces and with law enforcement to tackle the global issues that could impact your daily life: \u00a0crime, terrorism, trafficking of all kinds, border security, corruption, and more.<\/p>\n<p>That brings me to number four: \u00a0democracy and governance. \u00a0Again, Ghana\u2019s reputation in this area is laudable. \u00a0You have active political parties and civil society organizations; a free press; a history of peaceful political transitions; and an apolitical military. \u00a0These are things to be proud of.<\/p>\n<p>What a year it has been for both our countries: \u00a0Americans selected a new president in November, and then Ghanaians chose a new president in December.\u00a0 Both countries showed our traditions of peaceful, democratic elections. \u00a0And now we are both working through the process of establishing new leaders in government.\u00a0 I know that there are still many open questions with the new Trump administration.\u00a0 But I can assure you of this:\u00a0 We have seen that, historically, U.S. policy in Africa has been built on shared values and the overarching interests in democracy, economic development, and security. \u00a0President Kennedy started the Peace Corps \u2014 with Ghana the first country to receive American volunteers, and every subsequent American Administration has sent Peace Corps Volunteers to Ghana \u2014 more than 5,000 to date.\u00a0 President Clinton signed AGOA.\u00a0 President George W. Bush launched the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief or PEPFAR and the Millennium Challenge Corporation.\u00a0 President Obama continued all of those, and started Power Africa, Trade Africa, the Global Entrepreneurship Summits, and the Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI).\u00a0 Again this year, an outstanding group of YALI Mandela Washington Fellows from Ghana and other African countries will travel to the United States for at least six weeks of leadership training and exposure to high-level management. \u00a0Working with the private sector, we have also expanded the opportunities for young people to receive leadership training right here in Africa. \u00a0Four YALI Regional Leadership Centers \u2014 including one in Accra \u2014 bring together young leaders by sub-region and language. \u00a0But improving your leadership capability can be as simple as joining the YALI Network, a virtual community that links more than 200,000 young people across the continent and offers free online courses on the topics that matter most to you.<\/p>\n<p>To summarize: \u00a0Our mission supports economic growth; health and education; peace and security; democracy and governance: \u00a0We partner with Ghanaians across the country to achieve these mutual goals \u2014 from Flagstaff House to rural shea producers, from journalists and soldiers to students just like you. \u00a0Why? \u00a0We do it because we all benefit from a peaceful, prosperous, democratic world.<\/p>\n<p>You are the next generation that will take on the task of developing Ghana and a more peaceful, more prosperous, and more democratic world. \u00a0We want to play a role in equipping you to be great leaders. \u00a0I believe that the key is education. \u00a0President Kennedy once suggested that education is: \u201c\u2026 the means of developing our greatest abilities.\u201d\u00a0 He went on to say that is because \u201c .. [I]n each of us there is a private hope and dream which, fulfilled, can be translated into benefit for everyone and greater strength for [the] nation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Your education is the greatest investment you will ever make. \u00a0If you want to explore study in my country, we have an EducationUSA center in our Embassy that guides students looking to the United States for their next degree. \u00a0In fact, there are more than 3,100 Ghanaian students enrolled at colleges and universities in the United States, and our colleges and universities are looking to recruit more.<\/p>\n<p>Ghana is a popular destination for American students. \u00a0Around 2,300 American students come to Ghana each year, including a large group coming to Legon. \u00a0Perhaps we have some represented in the audience here today. \u00a0I encourage you to get to know one another. \u00a0Some of the relationships you create here will last a lifetime. \u00a0And tomorrow\u2019s challenges do not need to be faced alone.<\/p>\n<p>Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana\u2019s founding father, once said that \u201cAction without thought is empty. Thought without action is blind.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>You are receiving an excellent education here\u2014an education that will enable you to put your thoughts into action for Ghana\u2019s future and Africa\u2019s future, and ensure your actions are backed by thought.<\/p>\n<p>We believe in the power of education and technology to bring about a better world, and in the power of young people to bring about that better world. \u00a0Be bold. \u00a0Be creative. \u00a0Be inclusive. \u00a0We are in this together, and we will do great things.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for your attention.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; Ambassador Baah-Duodu, Distinguished Guests, Faculty and Staff, Students, Colleagues, I\u2019m honored to be here at the Legon Center for International Affairs and Diplomacy today. \u00a0Being here reminds me of my own career trajectory. \u00a0Before I became a diplomat, I taught English and American Civilization at a French university. \u00a0Being back in a respected academic &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1058,"featured_media":17297,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_gpalab_slo_mission_select":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[4,6739,6733,54],"tags":[6776,6741,4058],"class_list":["post-17294","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-ambassador","category-former-u-s-government-leaders","category-president-of-the-united-states","category-speeches","tag-barack-obama","tag-donald-j-trump","tag-leciad"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Remarks for Ambassador Robert P.
