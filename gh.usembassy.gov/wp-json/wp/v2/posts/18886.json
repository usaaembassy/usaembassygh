The U.S.-Ghana relationship is dynamic and rich, marked<br \/>\nby deep connections between our peoples in heritage, culture, education, business, and the arts (to<br \/>\nname a few sectors). Unfortunately, we also share inextricable connections to the historical slave<br \/>\ntrade, and the challenges we both face today in addressing modern slavery. Each time I have visited<br \/>\nthe slave castles at Cape Coast and Elmina, I am reminded of how the greed and inhumanity of all<br \/>\nthose involved in that evil trade left deep scars on both our countries. But from that painful history<br \/>\nwe have built a future of hope and still seek to further perfect our Union. African Americans have<br \/>\nenriched all sectors in the United States through their immense talents and contributions, and Ghana<br \/>\ntoday sets a global example of a successful democracy. Yet we must see through shared historical<br \/>\ninjustices the urgent need to abolish modern day slavery in our nations today.<\/p>\n<p>The human trafficking we see today may look different from the historical slave trade, but the effect<br \/>\nof robbing victims of their dignity and freedom is the same. And whether it be in 1818 or 2018,<br \/>\nslavery undermines our shared ability to achieve the just and prosperous future we all wish to<br \/>\nachieve. In the words of Pope Francis, human trafficking is a \u201ccrime that becomes ever more<br \/>\naggressive, that threatens not just individuals, but the foundational values of society.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The United States is proud to support efforts to combat human trafficking around the world. We do<br \/>\nthis through advocacy, programming, and our annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report<br \/>\ndocumenting the efforts of 187 governments in combating human trafficking, including the United<br \/>\nStates.<\/p>\n<p>Released on June 28, the eighteenth annual TIP Report notes some of the Ghanaian government\u2019s<br \/>\nsuccesses in 2017, including implementing a national anti-trafficking plan and prosecuting and<br \/>\nconvicting an increased number of labor and sex traffickers. Although Ghana does not meet the<br \/>\nminimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking, these increased efforts have resulted in<br \/>\nGhana\u2019s upgrade from Tier 2 Watch List to a Tier 2 ranking in the 2018 TIP Report.<\/p>\n<p>I urge all Ghanaians to read the report and consider the real threats and effects of slavery today. This<br \/>\nshould motivate us all to look in our own backyards, reflect, and commit to \u201cnot one more victim.\u201d<br \/>\nI\u2019ll never forget the children I have seen, some as young as four years old, trafficked to Lake Volta<br \/>\nand forced to risk their lives diving into cold water to untangle their master\u2019s fishing nets. Or, the<br \/>\nstories of girls from the village who are promised opportunity in the \u201cbig city\u201d as domestic helpers,<br \/>\nbut are rather trapped spending long days in servitude cleaning and cooking rather than in school. In<br \/>\na country that has become a beacon of hope and leadership throughout Africa, these Ghanaian<br \/>\nchildren deserve better.<\/p>\n<p>The TIP Report also recognizes all that we can achieve through partnership and coordinated action to<br \/>\ncombat trafficking. For example, it recounts how in one Ghanaian community, traditional leaders<br \/>\nand elders collaborated with a community child protection committee and a district social welfare<br \/>\nofficer to understand the dangers of human trafficking and develop a community approach to<br \/>\nmitigate those dangers. This community\u2019s efforts, combined with the efforts of leaders in several<br \/>\nother communities, has led to more than 180 children being saved from exploitation. As the TIP<br \/>\nReport notes, \u201cwhen communities are aware and their efforts coordinated, justice and freedom can<br \/>\nprevail.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Road Ahead<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Although the 2018 TIP Report commended many recent successes we have seen in Ghana and<br \/>\nthroughout the world, we must not lose sight of the hurdles we face advancing down the path toward<br \/>\nthe elimination of human trafficking. In Ghana, the government must continue to send the message<br \/>\nto perpetrators of human trafficking that modern day slavery will not be tolerated, and that they will<br \/>\nbe held accountable for their crimes.<\/p>\n<p>Government, civil society, and Ghanaians must come together to achieve the noble aims set forth in<br \/>\nGhana\u2019s first-ever National Plan of Action for the Elimination of Human Trafficking. With the<br \/>\nscourge of sex trafficking of women and girls growing within Ghana and throughout the region, and<br \/>\nthe forced labor of children \u2013 especially in the fishing and illegal mining sectors &#8212; persisting in<br \/>\nunacceptable numbers, more resources should be dedicated to providing trauma-informed care and<br \/>\nreintegration services for victims. In 2018, a Ghanaian should not buy \u2013 or be able to buy \u2013 a child<br \/>\nfor 100 cedis. Action is necessary to maintain or improve Ghana\u2019s TIP Report tier ranking and,<br \/>\nmore importantly, to ensure Ghana\u2019s men, women and children are not robbed of their opportunity to<br \/>\ncontribute to Ghana\u2019s future.<\/p>\n<p>More importantly, we all must remember that the victims of human trafficking are not strangers.<br \/>\nThey are our fellow human beings who suffer enslavement, degradation, and the denial of their own<br \/>\nhumanity. They are our sons and daughters, family members, friends, and neighbors. They are us.<br \/>\nWe must stand up for them and declare with resolve: \u201cNot One More Victim.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Over my nearly three years as U.S. Ambassador to Ghana, I have had many opportunities to reflect on the close ties between our two nations.
