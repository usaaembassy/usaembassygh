Beick Baffour;<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Distinguished officers and students of this institution;<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Distinguished guests;<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Members of the media;<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">All protocols observed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Good Afternoon, and thank you for welcoming me today. \u00a0I\u2019m truly honored to be standing here in this center of excellence dedicated to developing military, security, and civilian leaders not just from Ghana but from throughout the region. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Although this is my first opportunity to visit the Command and Staff College since I arrived in Ghana not quite a year ago, it\u2019s by no means the first time I\u2019ve seen Ghana\u2019s leadership and commitment to strengthening regional security cooperation and exporting peace far beyond Ghana\u2019s borders.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I\u2019ve worked on Africa for much of my diplomatic career, including spending significant time and attention on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and I know the tremendous work Ghanaian peacekeepers have done there, just as they have in Lebanon and Rwanda, in Cambodia and Bosnia, and many other places.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I also represent the United States on the Governing Board of the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre, and I\u2019ve spoken at several KAIPTC events and attended a graduation ceremony. \u00a0And I have to say, I\u2019ve been so inspired by what I saw there, and by what I know you do here at the Command and Staff College, that I\u2019m almost tempted to enroll. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I just need to be sure no one misunderstands me and thinks I said <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">enlist<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But kidding aside, I\u2019d actually be proud to serve with you in the Ghana Armed Forces, just as the United States government is proud of our partnership with the Ghana Armed Forces and with all of our African partners represented here today. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Because those partnerships are the basis on which we build the future \u2013 not just in the security sphere, but also economically, politically, culturally, and in countless other ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And so I\u2019m very pleased to speak with you today about how U.S. foreign policy in Africa is in fact all about partnership, and about the future. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Our Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Ambassador Tibor Nagy, has remarked that we need to start looking at Africa \u201cthrough the windshield\u201d rather than \u201cin the rearview mirror.\u201d \u00a0And he\u2019s right. For too long, we\u2019ve focused on where African countries have been, rather than where you are, and what you want to achieve. So I\u2019m going to focus on how we work together to get you there\u2026 to get us all there\u2026 \u00a0to what we all see, and want to see, out the windshield.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In that vein, last December, President Trump\u2019s National Security Advisor, Ambassador John Bolton, unveiled the Administration\u2019s new Africa Strategy, which emphasizes that enduring stability, prosperity, independence, and security across Africa are in the national security interest of the United States. \u00a0And, to that end, our Africa Strategy incorporates three core themes:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">First, <\/span><b>advancing U.S. trade and commercial ties<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> with African nations in ways that benefit both the United States and Africa. \u00a0We want our partners to thrive, prosper, and control their own destinies. We ask only for reciprocity. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Second, <\/span><b>countering the threat from terror networks and violent conflict<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. \u00a0Any sound U.S. strategy toward Africa must address this serious threat in a comprehensive way. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And third, <\/span><b>ensuring that assistance provided with U.S. taxpayer dollars is used efficiently and effectively<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. \u00a0Here in Ghana, we also often talk specifically about the goal of enhancing good governance, which is clearly related to the effective and efficient use of resources \u2013 be they ours, or those of the Ghanaian government and people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So let me take each of these three themes in turn.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Our first priority, enhancing U.S. economic trade and investment ties, is a two-way street in which both you and we benefit. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To expand our economic relationships, we\u2019ve developed a new initiative called \u201cProsper Africa,\u201d which will support U.S. investment, expand Africa\u2019s middle class, and improve the overall business climate. \u00a0We are encouraging African governments to choose high-quality, transparent, inclusive, and sustainable foreign investment projects, including those with support from the United States. The U.S. vision for the region is one of independence, self-reliance, and growth &#8211; not dependency, domination, and debt. \u00a0We want African nations, including Ghana, to succeed and to flourish.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We are expanding and modernizing our development tools \u2013 such as the \u201cBUILD Act\u201d that was passed and signed into law last year \u2013 to support access to financing and provide strong alternatives to external, state-directed initiatives. \u00a0The BUILD Act establishes a new U.S. International Development Finance Corporation to consolidate, modernize and reform our \u201cdevelopment finance\u201d capabilities and help mobilize additional private sector investment. And Africa as a region has the greatest exposure, with a potential of up to $6 billion in financing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But increased investment is only one part of it. \u00a0Trade is another. The United States firmly believes that African nations and peoples can and should increasingly benefit from a refocusing from aid to trade. \u00a0In the coming months and years, we will pursue modern, comprehensive trade agreements that ensure fair and reciprocal exchanges. We will begin these negotiations bilaterally and focus on creating mutually beneficial partnerships that will help expand market access for U.S. exports, while promoting sustainable local growth. \u00a0And the African Growth and Opportunity Act, AGOA, has increased opportunities for African goods, including Ghanaian goods, to access the U.S. market. Africa\u2019s share of global commerce is growing, and U.S. companies\u2019 presence along with it. Everybody wins.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But some of you may ask, \u201cWhy choose American companies over others?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">American businesses emphasize rule of law, transparency, recourse for investors, and a level playing field\u2026 all critical to advancing an entrepreneurial culture and thriving economy. \u00a0When U.S. companies develop projects, they demonstrate good business practices others can follow and build upon. We call on U.S. business to take up this challenge, and to embrace the vast opportunities that Africa offers. \u00a0We seek to do business not just <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Africa, but <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">with<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Africa, and to invest in Africans. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As we look out that windshield that Assistant Secretary Nagy refers to, we have to acknowledge that one of the biggest challenges Africa will face is what has become known as the \u201cyouth bulge.\u201d \u00a0By 2050, Africa\u2019s population is predicted to double to more than two billion. More than 75 percent of those (or 1.5 billion people) will be under age 25, and they will rightly hope for good jobs and a good quality of life \u2013 no different than young people anywhere in the world. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It\u2019s incumbent on all of us \u2013 across national boundaries, and in both government and the private sector \u2013 to create the enabling environment that will allow them to achieve those goals. \u00a0Today, six of the ten fastest growing economies in the world are in Africa, but this forward momentum has to become even stronger if we\u2019re going to meet the employment demands of a billion and a half young people just 30 years from now. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Already, modern technology and social media are allowing people around the world to compare their own circumstances with those of their peers around the globe. \u00a0Farmers and herders in remote villages can now know how much cassava, potatoes, or goats will sell for in urban markets, thus empowering and emboldening them to seek better prices for their goods. \u00a0But if what they see \u2013 or, what they believe they see \u2013 is the possibility of a better life and better opportunities elsewhere, they\u2019re going to pursue it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That\u2019s why private sector growth through which African companies and entrepreneurs create jobs for their fellow Africans is so important. \u00a0Because if this doesn\u2019t happen, I fear that we will see increases in dangerous migration patterns across the Sahara and the Mediterranean, as well as greater temptations to join violent extremist groups or turn to crime. \u00a0The economic and security aspects of our engagement are inextricably linked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And that brings me to the second pillar of our Africa Strategy, and perhaps the one that would seem most directly relevant to members of the armed forces, and students at the Command and Staff College: \u00a0the joint pursuit of greater regional stability and security.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As countries grow economically, they become better prepared to address security threats, including terrorism and militant violence. \u00a0And so we will continue to help African governments build the capacity of their security services and institutions to provide effective, reliable security and law enforcement to their citizens. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Here in Ghana, we\u2019ve partnered with a number of ministries as well as the Ghana Armed Forces through our \u201cSecurity Governance Initiative\u201d (or \u201cSGI\u201d) to enhance Ghana\u2019s abilities in maritime security, cyber security, and border security \u2013 specific focal areas identified by the government of Ghana. \u00a0Next week, in fact, Ghana will host a U.S. delegation here in Accra for the semi-annual SGI Steering Committee meeting, at which we will take stock of our progress \u2013 really, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">your<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> progress \u2013 towards these goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Through these political- and technical-level engagements, as well as facilitating joint military exercises and providing classroom training, the United States has worked to help our African partners further develop the necessary skills to provide security and stability to your own countries, and to project these beyond your borders. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At the beginning of my remarks, I mentioned the long and admirable tradition of Ghanaian participation in UN peacekeeping operations. \u00a0The United States has provided peacekeeper training to over 20 African countries. Ten years ago, Africans were 40 percent of the continent\u2019s peacekeepers; now it is 60 percent. \u00a0Worldwide, as of March this year, the UN lists five African countries among the top ten troop-contributors. Ghana is ninth on that global list \u2013 an achievement, and a commitment, you should be proud of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We also support the African Union\u2019s Peace and Security Architecture, with early warning and conflict prevention, maritime and border security, and mitigating trafficking in arms, drugs, and wildlife. \u00a0And we agree with the AU\u2019s goal that African nations and institutions need to take greater ownership of peace and security on the continent. In Somalia, the AU-led AMISOM mission, which the United States supports, reflects the desire of regional states to bring stability and prosperity to their neighbor, and by extension, to the entire Horn.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But in all of this, we must ensure that these operations are efficient and effective in carrying out their mandates\u2026. Just as, in keeping with the Africa Strategy unveiled by National Security Advisor Bolton in December, we want to ensure efficiency and effectiveness in our foreign assistance \u2013 the third of the Strategy\u2019s three pillars.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We want to partner with governments that are striving towards improved governance, better service delivery to their citizens, and transparent business practices. \u00a0Countries receiving U.S. assistance must invest in health and education, encourage accountable and transparent governance, support fiscal transparency, and promote rule of law and human rights. \u00a0And, I\u2019m happy to say, our partnership with Ghana has already fostered important and impressive strides in all of those areas. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The United States is helping, on both the governmental and private sector levels. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One of the sectors where we have seen the greatest success is energy. \u00a0From hydroelectric dam projects (including Akosombo, here in Ghana), to the exploitation of off-shore oil and gas fields, to more recent forays into biofuels and solar, African countries and companies have been making important progress. \u00a0And this is critical, because although safe, reliable, and affordable electricity is a critical underpinning of economic development, it\u2019s estimated that some 600 million people in Africa still lack access to electricity. That needs to change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The U.S. National Security Strategy focuses heavily on export promotion, energy security, and energy access. \u00a0Across Africa, within the framework of our Power Africa initiative, we\u2019re working to broaden the economic and social benefits of free, fair, and transparent energy markets. \u00a0Free markets drive economic growth, and diversity in energy sources and routes protects countries against unexpected changes, be they market-driven or politically motivated. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The recent concession transfer of the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) to the private consortium known as Power Distribution Services (PDS) is a great example. \u00a0This is part of our half-billion-dollar compact with Ghana through the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation, and the largest single transaction within the Power Africa context. \u00a0And it is an undertaking, in the context of the U.S. Africa Strategy, that goes directly to the idea of using U.S. taxpayer dollars efficiently and effectively for the common good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The common good. \u00a0Or, to put it differently, all the good things we have in common. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As I said at the outset, I\u2019ve spent a good part of my nearly 28 years in the U.S. diplomatic service working in and on Africa, because I love this continent and all it has to offer. \u00a0I first landed in Douala, Cameroon, in 1992 at the age of 22 \u2026 Feel free to do the math\u2026 and I\u2019ve served in or at least visited another 15 African countries since then. Africa has its challenges, no doubt. \u00a0So do we, in the United States. But more than any challenges, Africa has promise. African Affairs Assistant Secretary Nagy calls himself an \u201cAfro-Optimist.\u201d So am I. I look through that \u201cwindshield\u201d he describes, and I\u2019ll tell you what I see:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Africa is at a critical crossroads, and the direction it takes in the next few years will have a major impact \u2013 not only on the continent, but throughout the world.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">African countries are rapidly transitioning from donor-dependency to relationships increasingly based on cooperation, mutual respect, transparency, and self-reliance. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Our people-to-people ties are expanding. \u00a0I remember having college classmates who did semesters abroad in South Africa and Senegal. \u00a0They came back changed, with broadened world views they would never have developed otherwise. \u00a0We need more of that, and we need it in both directions. The Mandela Washington Fellowship program, part of our Young African Leaders Initiative (or YALI), helps African youth enhance their leadership skills, entrepreneurship, and networks that they can put into action back home. \u00a0As one Mandela Washington Fellow said, <\/span><b><i>\u201cI went to America, and found Africa.\u201d<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">More and more Americans are finding Africa, too. \u00a0Through academic exchanges and business ties, serving with you in peacekeeping missions, and easier, direct air travel (not to mention the Internet), we\u2019re building relationships that will increase understanding and change lives. \u00a0That\u2019s the future I see through the windshield, and the United States will continue to be by your side to help us all get there. Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Commandant of Ghana\u2019s Armed Forces Command and Staff College, Rear Admiral M.
