Today kicks off a very important program for Ghana.\u00a0 One that will appropriately strengthen press freedom and accountability.<\/p>\n<p>Freedom of speech, freedom to assemble, and freedom of the press are fundamental principles for every democracy.\u00a0 Without even one of these, democracy cannot long survive.\u00a0 A safe, free, professional, and responsible media supports democratic principles and informs current public policy debates so that voters can make informed decisions.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s been said that information is the currency of democracy.\u00a0 And that\u2019s where you come in. Your role as journalists is fundamental to public debate on key issues. With a stroke of the pen, you can highlight a public problem or injustice.\u00a0You can show people how public policy is working or isn\u2019t working. \u00a0You can hold government and public officials accountable to their promises.\u00a0You can ask tough questions that demand answers.\u00a0But with that power comes great responsibility.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s essential to do your research.\u00a0 Check and double-check your sources.\u00a0Seek a different perspective.\u00a0 Don\u2019t be misled by a Kweku Ananse who feeds you one side of a story! We are all better served by well-rounded, fact-based reporting that allows the public to hear all sides.\u00a0Often that means not being the first to break the news.<\/p>\n<p>With strong and professional reporting, you can bring balance to public policy debates.\u00a0You can remove emotion and replace it with the facts that let us all participate in democracy.\u00a0You can give a voice to all sides in a debate, even if you personally disagree with some views.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is an ardent defender of a free and responsible press that can operate safely.\u00a0 We support various programs throughout the year that strengthen press freedom, and also strengthen journalism as a profession.\u00a0 Because we, too, believe that accurate information is the currency of democracy.<\/p>\n<p>To that end, we have just released our annual call for funding proposals, including programs that promote press freedom, media literacy, and combatting disinformation and misinformation.\u00a0 The deadline to submit Statements of Interest is February 1.\u00a0 I hope some of you will consider applying for this opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to close by congratulating the Ministry of Information, the National Media Commission, the Ghana Journalists Association, the Ghana Institute of Journalism, the University of Ghana, and others for their contributions to this program.\u00a0 We stand behind you in this effort and are ready to assist in any way that we can.<\/p>\n<p>We are pleased to be here among our friends to support this initiative.
