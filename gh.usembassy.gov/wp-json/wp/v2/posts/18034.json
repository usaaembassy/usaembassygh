\u00a0Why do we support training for nurses and for soldiers? \u00a0It\u2019s for precisely the same reason: our futures are linked. \u00a0Our success is mutual, and that success is so much more likely when we know each other, when we understand each other\u2019s values and goals \u2014 when we <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">trust<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> each other. \u00a0In 2017, we can Skype, we can tweet at each other, we can WhatsApp. \u00a0There are myriad ways for us to connect with others around the world. \u00a0But I still firmly believe that there is no substitute for that last three feet. \u00a0Those personal connections will withstand the efforts of those who seek to divide us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I applaud AFS for your decades of bringing people together. \u00a0To AFS-Ghana: Fifty years is an impressive anniversary for any organization. \u00a0I understand that it truly is 50 straight years, even through some challenging times. \u00a0Your steadfast commitment to cross-cultural understanding is an example for the world. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Each of us in this room, in our own way, in our own corner of the globe, is working toward a more just and peaceful world. \u00a0It is important work. \u00a0It is our privilege to partner with you, and we thank you for your tireless efforts to prepare the next generation of global citizens \u2014 a generation filled with confidence, optimism, and the belief that, together, we can accomplish anything. \u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thank you. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Honorable Minister of State for Tertiary Education Kwesi Yankah, President of AFS International, Daniel Obst, Chair of the AFS Board of Trustees, Vishakha Desai, AFS-Ghana Board Chair, Reverend Alan Okomeng-Mensah, AFS Partners from around the world, Colleagues, Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, Good evening. \u00a0It is my pleasure to join you here tonight to celebrate 50 &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1058,"featured_media":18031,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_gpalab_slo_mission_select":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[4,54],"tags":[4128,4130],"class_list":["post-18034","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-ambassador","category-speeches","tag-afs-programs","tag-yes-program"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>AFS Global Citizenship Education Dinner Celebrating 50 Years in Ghana Remarks by Ambassador Robert P.
