This year marks the 30th anniversary of the global 16 Days of Activism campaign, providing an opportunity for the United States to reaffirm its enduring commitment to preventing and responding to gender-based violence.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re all too familiar with the statistic that one in three women is assaulted in her lifetime and that reports of domestic violence have increased worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0 We know too well that gender-based violence robs a person of dignity and opportunity. We also know that our collective efforts are moving the needle on these statistics.\u00a0 We support community leaders and civil society who are raising awareness to change the narrative and empowering girls and women for greater opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>We also promote the efforts of those striving to ensure better, more accessible, support services are delivered to those in need. \u00a0Preventing and responding to all forms of gender-based violence is a top priority in the U.S. government\u2019s commitment to promoting democracy, advancing human rights, and furthering gender equality.\u00a0The United States stands with\u00a0female human rights defenders\u00a0and salutes the critical role they\u00a0play in securing\u00a0universal and equal access to the fundamental freedoms\u00a0of all persons.<\/p>\n<p>We know that empowering women contributes to social stability, security, and peace.\u00a0 That\u2019s why promoting human rights, especially gender equity, is among our top priorities.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_22129\" aria-labelledby=\"figcaption_attachment_22129\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" style=\"width: 360px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-22129\" title=\"Amb Sullivan\" src=\"https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/Amb-Sullivan-350x350.jpg\" alt=\"Ambassador Sullivan: &quot;Empowering women contributes to stability, security, and peace.

Our Mission supports women\u2019s entrepreneurship; provides grants for women to scale up their business; promotes export opportunities through the African Growth and Opportunity Act; inspires more girls to pursue STEM subjects in school; and promotes professional development for female educators.<\/p>\n<p>We support the courageous storytellers \u2013 the artists, the academics, the filmmakers, and the journalists &#8211; who help get the difficult stories told, who offer opportunity for victims to become empowered, and who embolden survivors.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, we\u2019re committed to supporting meaningful participation of women in all decision-making processes, because when women are at the table, it leads to better and more sustainable policies and outcomes\u2014not only for women, but for entire communities and countries.<\/p>\n<p>In short, when women achieve their full potential, we all win.<\/p>\n<p>Among us here tonight are some of our invaluable partners with whom we collaborate to overcome the challenges and unleash women\u2019s full potential in shaping their own stories and their communities. YOU are the inspiring service providers, activists, artists, journalists, and policy makers.<\/p>\n<p>On November 25, the U.S. Embassy launched our 16-day multi-media campaign to further build awareness of how gender inequality enables gender-based violence to persist.<\/p>\n<p>Over the past 15 days, our Mission joined several of Ghana\u2019s influential champions for women\u2019s rights and advocates to help raise the volume to the global cry, \u201cEnd violence against women now!\u201d\u00a0 Say it with me, \u201cEnd violence against women now!\u201d I\u2019m proud to join these champions with my own message on our U.S. Embassy social media platforms tomorrow.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m so pleased to see many of you here tonight.\u00a0 Your words and your actions have reached more than 200,000 people on our U.S. Mission\u2019s social media platforms alone \u2013 and we thank each of you for sharing these important stories on your own social media pages.\u00a0 We hope the campaign has highlighted the benefits to society when women and girls are safe and empowered, and living, studying, and working in an environment where they can thrive and be all that they can be! We hope more people were encouraged to actively speak out against gender-based violence. We hope our campaign sensitized people to the reality that some are at greater risk of violence \u2013 including persons with disabilities, those in fragile and conflict-affected areas, and members of the LGBTQI+ community.\u00a0\u00a0All deserve the right to live free of violence and reach their emotional, educational, and professional potential.\u00a0I\u2019m honored to be surrounded by such brave and bold citizens who care deeply about Ghana and its people.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I would like to invite each of our 16 Days of Activism Champions to please join me when I call your name.\u00a0 <\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dorcas Ama Frema Coker-Appiah<\/strong>, Executive Director of the Gender Studies and Human Rights Documentation Centre<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mama Atrato II<\/strong>, Queen Mother of Ho, also known as Josephine Dzah<\/li>\n<li><strong>Rebecca Ohene-Asah<\/strong>, storyteller and professor at the National Film and Television Institute<\/li>\n<li><strong>Regina Asamoah<\/strong>, News Editor at Atinka FM\/TV and activist\/documentary filmmaker<\/li>\n<li><strong>Dinah Adiko<\/strong>, Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Consultant<\/li>\n<li><strong>Chief Inspector Benedicta Okyerewaa Biney<\/strong>, Western Region, Domestic Violence and Victim Support Unit (DOVVSU) Sekondi<\/li>\n<li><strong>Lamnatu Adam<\/strong>, Executive Director of Songtaaba<\/li>\n<li><strong>Queen Boresah<\/strong>, the Nkilgiwurche Boresah Iddisah Jeduah 1<\/li>\n<li><strong>Florence Toffa<\/strong>, Director of the American Corner Agbogba and CEO of Mobile Web Ghana, along with some of the amazing women behind the ongoing American Space series, \u201cShifting Blame\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Patience Quaye, <\/strong>Assistant Commissioner of Police (retired)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sophia Eva Ennim, <\/strong>Superintendent of Police, Domestic Violence and Victim Support Unit Coordinator, Madina Division<\/li>\n<li><strong>Dr. Mrs. Dzifa Attah<\/strong>, Clinical Psychologist &amp; Senior Lecturer, University of Ghana Medical School<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ms. Lilipearl Baaba Otoo<\/strong>, Journalist at The Business &amp; Financial Times (BFT) and Founder of Bridge for Equity NGO<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><u>Not with us this evening, but also a key part of the campaign:<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Her Royal Highness <strong>Lady Julia Osei Tutu, <\/strong>Manhyia Palace<\/li>\n<li><strong>Dr. Angela Dwamena-Aboagye<\/strong>, Executive Director of The Ark Foundation<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ms. Annabelle Pwalia<\/strong>, Crisis Center Manager at The Ark Foundation<\/li>\n<li><strong>Naval Captain Veronica Adzo Arhin<\/strong>, Gender Policy Advisor to the Chief of Defense Staff, Ghana Armed Services and<\/li>\n<li><strong>Chief Superintendent Owusuwaa Kyeremeh,<\/strong> Director of the Domestic Violence and Victim Support Unit (DOVVSU) of the Ghana Police Service<\/li>\n<li><strong>Professor Akosua Adomako Ampofo<\/strong>, activist scholar and Professor of African and Gender Studies at the Institute of African Studies, University of Ghana<\/li>\n<li><strong>Abigail Ofori-Amanfo<\/strong>, Gender Activist and Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Specialist.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Thank you all for your contributions during the 16 Days and throughout the year!<\/p>\n<p>Ayikoo!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>December 9, 2021 Representative of the Government of Ghana; Members of the Diplomatic Corps; Honored guests, friends, and our 16 Days of Activism Champions, Akwaaba to my home and thank you for joining me this evening. \u00a0Welcome also to our visiting Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement, Toby Bradley. &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1058,"featured_media":22141,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_gpalab_slo_mission_select":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[4,3998,1169,54,61],"tags":[7136],"class_list":["post-22128","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-ambassador","category-gender-issues","category-human-rights","category-speeches","category-us-and-gh","tag-ambassador-sullivan"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) -
