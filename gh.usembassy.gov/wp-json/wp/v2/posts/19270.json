Lamora\u2019s Remarks<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>YALI Learns Workshop on <\/strong><strong>\u201cUnderstanding the Rights of Women and Girls\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Tuesday, December 4, 2018 <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Good morning.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m honored to be here today to show the U.S. Embassy\u2019s support for the annual, worldwide 16 Days of Activism against Gender-based Violence (GBV) campaign.\u00a0 Whether you\u2019re an advocate, a subject matter expert, a survivor, a family member or friend of a survivor, we welcome you to this interactive YALI Learns workshop on \u201cUnderstanding the Rights of Women and Girls.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0Thank you all for joining us.<\/p>\n<p>Gender-based violence has many harmful consequences. This year, the U.S. Government is highlighting ways in which gender-based violence is a pervasive barrier to women\u2019s empowerment and economic growth.\u00a0 Domestic or intimate partner violence, street harassment and violence in public spaces, and sexual harassment in the workplace all have a direct negative impact on gender equality and women\u2019s economic empowerment.\u00a0 Settings that permit such violence or harassment not only discourage women from work, but can also result in emotional or other physical trauma that render women less likely to go to work.<\/p>\n<p>When women are \u201cSafe at Work\u201d and realizing their full potential, it generates positive dividends for society as a whole.<\/p>\n<p>In her remarks at the <strong>2017 Global Conference on Women and Entrepreneurship<\/strong>, former UN-Women <strong>Deputy Executive Director Lakshmi Puri stated, \u201c<\/strong>If women participate in economic activity, own and control productive assets, it leads to development by helping to overcome poverty, reducing inequality, and improving children\u2019s nutrition, health, and school attendance.\u201d \u00a0She also noted that \u201cthere is growing global consensus on women\u2019s economic empowerment as a force multiplier for good governance, economic growth, and poverty eradication.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>With this in mind, the U.S. Embassy is supporting economic empowerment of women through the African Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship Program (AWEP) while also supporting law enforcement\u2019s response in cases of gender-based violence.\u00a0 Through the West Africa Regional Training Center<strong>, the United States has provided training to Ghanaian police officers on responding to <\/strong>domestic and other sexual and gender-based violence, as well as leadership training for women in law enforcement.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. Embassy also serves as a convener of \u201csafe spaces.\u201d\u00a0 We provide a platform for programs in which advocates, social workers, and law enforcement specialists meet with survivors of gender-based violence and with audiences that are most vulnerable: adolescent girls and the disabled.\u00a0 We rely on a network of women leaders to facilitate these sessions. \u00a0Over time, this group has evolved to become the Woke Women Task Force.\u00a0 Thanks to these Woke Women, young girls and the disabled are \u201cwaking up\u201d and learning their rights from a young age so that when they face harassment and abuse, they are equipped with the knowledge and tools to confront and prevent it.<\/p>\n<p>As the acclaimed Ghanaian author Ama Ata Aidoo wrote in her novel \u201cOur Sister Killjoy,\u201d which I just finished reading about a month ago, women are often \u201cvictims of our history and our present.\u201d \u2026 But they don\u2019t have to be.\u00a0 History in this area need not repeat itself.\u00a0 And by ensuring that women and girls know their rights, collectively we can make important inroads towards a different future.<\/p>\n<p>Yet educating young girls is only effective if we also make it okay for boys and men to embrace gender equality and reject traditions and norms that oppress girls and women.\u00a0 Empowered women need the support and advocacy of men for real change to occur.<\/p>\n<p>When I was in college in Washington, DC, some 30 years ago now, a male friend of mine became very attuned to this issue and decided he wanted to make a difference.\u00a0 He and I were living in a house with several other students at the time, and basically, in our living room, a small, grass-roots organization was born.\u00a0 Its mission was to underscore that changing the mindsets of men, and more importantly boys, was critical to ending rape.<\/p>\n<p>My friend and his co-founders noted that the majority of violent acts against women are committed by men, but the vast majority of prevention efforts have historically been risk-reduction and self-defense tactics directed at women. \u00a0 The founders sought to change the conversation by shifting the responsibility of deterring harm away from women by focusing on promoting healthy, nonviolent masculinity. \u00a0Their vision offered a plan for prevention that outlined positive, proactive solutions by engaging boys and men between the ages of 11 and 22 as allies, inspiring them to feel motivated and capable of ending men\u2019s violence against women.<\/p>\n<p>And they made a difference, increasingly so as the organization\u2019s size and reach grew.\u00a0 Over the past three decades, the group has expanded to reach over two million boys and men across the United States and elsewhere.\u00a0 Have this organization and other like-minded organizations successfully put an end to all sexual and gender-based violence in my country?\u00a0 Of course not.\u00a0 But they\u2019ve changed mindsets, behaviors, and quite possibly lives.\u00a0 So this sort of effort, in my view, must go hand-in-hand with the very critical assistance we provide to women.\u00a0 Only when men and women are fully committed to partnering on this effort will we make real, long-term progress.<\/p>\n<p>Here in Ghana, the U.S. Embassy partners on anti-gender-based violence programming and advocacy across all sectors, including with government officials at the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection, law enforcement from the police and the Domestic Violence Victims Support Unit (DOVVSU), lawyers and human rights advocates, health workers, and a wide range of civil society organizations and volunteers.<\/p>\n<p>For example, Mobile Web Ghana is hosting today\u2019s YALI Learns workshop.\u00a0 The Director and CEO of Mobile Web Ghana, Florence Toffa, is a public health specialist and anti-GBV advocate.\u00a0 Under her direction, Mobile Web Ghana trains youth and women in mobile entrepreneurship.\u00a0 We\u2019re proud that Florence is an alumna of the Mandela Washington Fellowship in addition to being an active member of the Woke Women Task Force.\u00a0 Thank you Florence and the entire Mobile Web Ghana team for hosting us today.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is committed to promoting gender equality and advancing the status of women and girls around the world.\u00a0 We know that gender-based violence is a global challenge that crosses borders and cultures.\u00a0 Preventing and responding to violence against women and girls requires <em><u>all of us<\/u><\/em> to take action\u2014governments, individuals, the private sector, and civil society.<\/p>\n<p>We look to Ghana, a leader in Africa on so many things, to support efforts to keep girls in school and to support women in realizing their full potential, allowing them to contribute to peaceful and prosperous communities, and to the country as a whole. \u00a0On this point, I note that President Akufo-Addo was named the Chairperson for the African Union\u2019s Committed on Gender and Development in 2017 and has since launched the Gender and Development Initiative for Africa to promote gender equality in the workplace.\u00a0 We applaud this development and stand ready to partner with Ghana and other African nations to support such initiatives.<\/p>\n<p>In closing, I\u2019ll borrow the theme from the Woke Women Task Force: \u201cEmpowered females make our world better.\u201d\u00a0 I know that today\u2019s YALI Learns workshop will contribute to this ideal of empowering women for a better world.\u00a0 \u00a0Thank you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Accra, GHANA \u2013 In commemoration of the 16-Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence (GBV) Campaign, the U.S. Embassy
