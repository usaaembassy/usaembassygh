In Iraq and Syria, our coalition of some 60 nations, including Arab nations, is continuing our mission to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.<\/p>\n<p>Second, we have to confront the warped ideologies espoused by terrorists like al Qaeda, Boko Haram, and ISIL, especially their attempt to use Islam to justify their violence.\u00a0 As President Obama has noted, terrorists are desperate for legitimacy.\u00a0 And all of us have a responsibility to refute the notion that groups like ISIL or Boko Haram somehow represent Islam, because that is a falsehood that embraces the terrorist narrative.<\/p>\n<p>Third, we must address the grievances that terrorists exploit, including economic grievances.\u00a0 Poverty alone does not cause a person to become a terrorist, any more than poverty alone causes someone to become a criminal.\u00a0 There are millions, billions of people who are poor and are law-abiding and peaceful and tolerant, and are trying to advance their lives and the opportunities for their families.<\/p>\n<p>But when people &#8212; especially young people &#8212; feel entirely trapped in impoverished communities, where there is no order and no path for advancement, where there are no educational opportunities, where there are no ways to support families, and no escape from injustice and the humiliations of corruption &#8212; that feeds instability and disorder, and makes those communities ripe for extremist recruitment.\u00a0 And we have seen that across the Middle East and we&#8217;ve seen it across North Africa.\u00a0 So if we\u2019re serious about countering violent extremism, we have to get serious about confronting these economic grievances.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is making new commitments to help young people forge new collaborations in entrepreneurship and science and technology.\u00a0 The YALI program is expanding to 1000 fellows this year. And Ghana is host to one of only 4 YALI Regional Learning Centers in Africa (and one of only 2 opened today).<\/p>\n<p>We can all reaffirm our commitment to broad-based development that creates growth and jobs, not just for the few at the top, but for the many.\u00a0 We can step up our efforts against corruption, so a person can go about their day and an entrepreneur can start a business without having to pay a bribe.<\/p>\n<p>We must commit to expanding education, including for girls.\u00a0 And expand opportunities, including for women.<\/p>\n<p>Fourth, we have to address the political grievances that terrorists exploit.\u00a0 Again, there is not a single perfect causal link, but the link is undeniable.\u00a0 When people are oppressed, and human rights are denied &#8212; particularly along sectarian lines or ethnic lines &#8212; when dissent is silenced, it feeds violent extremism.\u00a0 It creates an environment that is ripe for terrorists to exploit.\u00a0 When peaceful, democratic change is impossible, it feeds into the terrorist propaganda that violence is the only answer available.<\/p>\n<p>And so we must recognize that lasting stability and real security require democracy.\u00a0 That means free elections where people can choose their own future, and independent judiciaries that uphold the rule of law, and police and security forces that respect human rights, and free speech and freedom for civil society groups.\u00a0 And it means freedom of religion &#8212; because when people are free to practice their faith as they choose, it helps hold diverse societies together.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. Government \u2013 through offices in the US Embassy, including USAID\u2014is supporting a wide range of programs and other initiatives to advance the themes of the White House Summit on Countering Violent Extremism (CVE). The United States will continue to advance ongoing and planned CVE efforts through robust programming and coordinated implementation totaling approximately $188 million.<\/p>\n<p>I would like to highlight a few examples of themes the US government is working on in Africa:<\/p>\n<p class=\"heading2_h2\">Improving and Sharing Analysis of Violent Extremism<\/p>\n<p>In Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia, ongoing programs focus on strengthening understanding of the local drivers of violent extremism. This includes research and trend analysis that focuses on gender and governance through \u201cRegional Violent Risk Assessments\u201d in Cameroon, Chad, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, and Uganda. The United States is also supporting civil society practitioners and partner governments to share the latest research on CVE through workshops, online trainings, and in practice.<\/p>\n<p class=\"heading2_h2\">Developing Skills, Expertise, and Strategies to Counter Violent Extremism<\/p>\n<p>Efforts in West Africa (working with the Economic Community of West Africa \/ECOWAS) and in the Horn of Africa (working with the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development), focus on developing national, multi-stakeholder strategies to address violent extremism. This includes providing and supporting training and exchanges of best practices among government and civil society leaders.<\/p>\n<p>New initiatives in North Africa and the Sahel will build capacity among community and government leaders to counter violent extremism locally with a variety of tools, including counter-messaging strategies. One example: USAID\u2019s West Africa Office in Accra is working on a regional project named Peace and Development Project (PDEV II); the U.S. Embassy Small Grants mechanism funds CVE efforts at the bilateral level.<\/p>\n<p class=\"heading2_h2\">Strengthening Community-Police and Community-Security Force Relations as Ingredients for Countering and Preventing the Spread of Violent Extremism<\/p>\n<p>These projects support the implementation of the Global Counter Terrorism Forum\u2019s (GCTF)\u00a0Good Practices on Community Engagement and Community-Oriented Policing as Tools to Counter Violent Extremism.<\/p>\n<p>The creation of an expert-led technical working group to study the relationship between security force-community relations and the prevalence of violent extremism will engage civil society, government, and multilateral partners. The group will develop a set of principles and recommendations for practitioners, public officials, and civil society, by examining common practice, empirical research, and case studies.<\/p>\n<p class=\"heading2_h2\">Building Community Resilience to Recruitment and Radicalization to Violent Extremism<\/p>\n<p>Ongoing efforts to build community resilience to recruitment and radicalization to violent extremism include projects to promote inclusive peace and reconciliation and encourage tolerance and respect of religious minorities. Continuing activities include dialogue across religious, sectarian, and ethnic lines, conflict resolution training, and working with community leaders and members to peacefully resolve problems together.<\/p>\n<p>These projects help build resilience among youth susceptible to recruitment and radicalization to violent extremism include encouraging youth to be catalysts for inter- and intra-faith cooperation in their communities, and enabling youth to become active advocates by providing technical skills and training, as well as offering opportunities for civic education, community service, and empowerment.<\/p>\n<p class=\"heading2_h2\">Elevating the Role of Religious Voices and Promoting Educational Initiatives to Build Resilience against Extremist Recruitment<\/p>\n<p>Support to amplify non-violent religious voices will: 1) mobilize religious leaders from conflict areas and encourage them to lead projects emphasizing peace, tolerance and coexistence at the community level; and 2) train religious leaders on conflict resolution and implementation of peace-building initiatives.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. is seeking to provide funding for a series of country-specific workshops focusing on rehabilitation and reintegration of foreign terrorist fighters hosted by the International Institute for Justice and the Rule of Law.\u00a0 (NOTE:\u00a0 The US Govenment sponsored a workshop on this issue for Francophone Africa on 22-24 July 2015 in Malta).<\/p>\n<p>Terrorists traffic in lies and stereotypes about others &#8212; other religions, other ethnic groups.\u00a0 So let\u2019s share the truth of our faiths with each other.\u00a0 Terrorists prey upon young impressionable minds.\u00a0 So let\u2019s bring our youth together to promote understanding and cooperation.<\/p>\n<p>The world hears a lot about the terrorists who attacked Charlie Hebdo in Paris, but the world has to also remember the Paris police officer, a Muslim, who died trying to stop them.\u00a0 The world knows about the attack on the Jews at the kosher supermarket in Paris; we need to recall the worker at that market, a Muslim, who hid Jewish customers and saved their lives.\u00a0 And when he was asked why he did it, he said, \u201cWe are brothers.\u00a0 It&#8217;s not a question of Jews or Christians or Muslims.\u00a0 We&#8217;re all in the same boat, and we have to help each other to get out of this crisis.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for being here today.\u00a0 As President Barack Obama recent noted, we come from different countries and different cultures, but it is useful for us to take our wisdom from that humble worker who engaged in heroic acts under the most severe of circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>We are all in the same boat.\u00a0 We have to help each other.\u00a0 In this work, you will have a strong partner in the United States of America.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you very much.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Thank you very much.
