Lamora\u2019s Remarks<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>at Welcome Reception in Honor of the <\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>2018 Ghana Cohort of Mandela Washington Fellows<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Marriott Hotel, Accra, October 11, 2018, 6:30-8:00 p.m.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Honored guests,<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re here tonight to welcome back our outstanding 2018 Mandela Washington Fellowship cohort.\u00a0 Let\u2019s give them another warm \u201cAkwaaba!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As you all know, the Fellowship is the flagship program of the Young African Leaders Initiative, or YALI.\u00a0 The key word here is \u201cleaders.\u201d\u00a0 Since 2010, YALI has supported more than 3,500 young African men and women in further developing the leadership skills and potential they had already demonstrated during the highly competitive and rigorous selection process.\u00a0 YALI, and more specifically the Mandela Washington Fellowship Program, is about growth.\u00a0 It\u2019s about progressive leadership development.\u00a0 It\u2019s about looking at the skills the program candidates demonstrated yesterday, that laid the groundwork to make them successful Fellows today, so they can be the leaders of their nations and our world tomorrow.<\/p>\n<p>Selected among thousands of extremely qualified candidates, the 33 talented young professionals present today represent Ghana\u2019s best and brightest in the areas of Business and Entrepreneurship, Civic Leadership, and Public Management.\u00a0 This year, these 33 Ghanaian fellows joined 700 others from all corners of the continent for an intensive six-week academic and leadership training program to help them effectively lead organizations, communities, and countries.<\/p>\n<p>In particular I would like to acknowledge Mr. Sena Koby Nyame.\u00a0 Sena returned home from his fellowship at Northwestern University and immediately sought opportunities to maximize the regional impact of this experience by campaigning for a seat on the 2018 YALI West Africa Regional Advisory Board.\u00a0 We are very proud that Ghana will be represented on this board where Sena will represent other fellows in the region and advise on U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) follow-on funding opportunities in Africa.\u00a0 Congratulations Sena!<\/p>\n<p>Our 2018 cohort joins more than 150 Ghanaian Mandela Washington Fellowship alumni.\u00a0 Alums like Ms. Adjo Dede Asare and Mr. Mutaru Mumuni Muqthar \u2013 both from the 2016 Mandela Washington Fellowship.<\/p>\n<p>Ms. Asare is the Managing Director of Alfie Designs, a garment manufacturing company.\u00a0 Since her fellowship experience, her business went from 25 to 100 employees, she expanded exports throughout the African continent and the United States, and she runs a fashion school that trains young girls how to sew at no charge.\u00a0 Through her efforts, Ms. Asare presents opportunities to young women to learn new skills to better their economic outlook while at the same time spur economic growth within the country.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Muqthar is another success story from the program.\u00a0 As the Executive Director of the West African Center for Counter Extremism (WACCE), Mr. Muqthar has made security and counterterrorism issues his life focus.\u00a0 Since 2016, WACCE has expanded its programming beyond Accra to the rest of Ghana and the West African region.\u00a0 And in January 2018, Mr. Muqthar was named the Daily Trust African of the Year 2017, making him the youngest recipient in the award\u2019s history.\u00a0 He joined the ranks of past recipients including Nobel Peace Prize winner Mukwege, a Congolese doctor recognized by the Nobel Committee just last week for his work with sexual assault victims in conflict areas.<\/p>\n<p>I point out Ms. Asare and Mr. Muqthar not to claim credit on behalf of the U.S. Government for their great success, but to highlight the value of creating space for talented, motivated individuals to gather, learn, share experiences, and help one another grow.\u00a0 That\u2019s what programs like the Mandela Washington Fellowship can achieve.<\/p>\n<p>But YALI doesn\u2019t start and end with the Mandela Washington Fellowship.\u00a0 The initiative also has the Regional Leadership Center programs and the on-line platform YALI Network.<\/p>\n<p>The four YALI Regional Leadership Centers \u2013 one of which is right here in Accra \u2013 provide in-person and on-line training in business and entrepreneurship, civic leadership, and public management. They also offer extensive opportunities for professional development and networking.\u00a0 The Accra Regional Leadership Center, located at the Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration, serves talented young leaders ages of 18 &#8211; 35 from nine West African countries &#8211; Burkina Faso, Cameroon, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, the Gambia, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Togo, and of course Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>Separately, the YALI Network provides members invaluable opportunities to connect with other leaders in their community and to learn from experts in their respective fields.\u00a0 The on-line platform has tens of thousands subscribers and offers on-line resources in a range of topics such as entrepreneurship, professional development, and human rights.<\/p>\n<p>Many of you returnees are probably asking yourselves: \u201cWhat now?\u201d\u00a0 The Fellowship has ended, but you\u2019re energized, full of ideas, and ready to leverage all those new connections you made through the program.<\/p>\n<p>I say:\u00a0 Don\u2019t let up.\u00a0 Continue your awesome work.\u00a0 Share your experiences with your colleagues, friends, neighbors, and families.\u00a0 Be leadership multipliers.\u00a0 Mentor those under and around you.\u00a0 I encourage all of our Mandela Washington Fellowship alumni to engage with Fellows from the Regional Leadership Centers and YALI Network members to maintain and expand this momentum.\u00a0 You\u2019ve already made significant strides on your own. \u00a0Just imagine what you can do together.<\/p>\n<p>Before I close my remarks, I want to congratulate 2018 Fellow Mr. Sena Nyame who was elected to the 2018 West Africa Regional Advisory Board.\u00a0 Let\u2019s give Mr. Nyame a round of applause.\u00a0 Best of luck, and represent Ghana well, as I know you will.<\/p>\n<p>2018 Fellows, I hope that you enjoyed a great Fellowship in the United States.\u00a0 My Embassy colleagues and I look forward to meeting as many of you tonight as we can to hear firsthand about your experiences and to learn more about your hopes and plans for the future.<\/p>\n<p>I, for one, cannot wait to see what you achieve next!<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On October 11, 2018, a welcome reception was held for the\u00a0 Ghana cohort of the 2018 Mandela Washington Fellowship.
