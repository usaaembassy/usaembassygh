Lamora traveled to the Ashanti Region from November 19-20 to promote partnerships on economic development, education, and good governance between the United States of America and the Republic of Ghana.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While in the Ashanti Region, DCM Lamora traveled to Ejura on November 19 to commission the Ejuraman Integrated Community Center for Employable Skills (ICCES) Training Center\u2019s new classroom block, a U.S. Ambassador\u2019s Special Self-Help project.\u00a0 In 2018, the U.S. Embassy awarded the center a grant of $11,000 to complete construction on a four-unit classroom block to provide vocational training to more than 250 students. During the commissioning, DCM Lamora lauded the ICCES Training Center for their continued efforts saying, \u201cWe know that increasing access to vocational training is key to developing Ghana and creates a pathway to improving economic independence.\u201d\u00a0 DCM Lamora also visited St. Monica\u2019s College in Mampong, a former U.S. Ambassador\u2019s Special Self-Help grant recipient. Through the Self-Help fund, St. Monica\u2019s College completed furnishings for an Information and Communication Technology Center that provides internet access and digital literacy training to its students.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Ambassador\u2019s Special Self-Help Program provides grants to small-scale, community development projects.\u00a0 Selected projects must be initiated by the community, sustainable and not require additional support, and have substantial in-kind contributions from the community. Since the program began worldwide in 1964, the U.S. Ambassador\u2019s Special Self-Help Program has distributed more than $2.1 million to communities in Ghana to help support their development.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">On November 20, DCM Lamora met with Manhyia Chief of Staff Nana Kofi Badu and Chief of Protocol Ernest Sarhene to discuss local governance and security issues as well as areas of collaboration such as youth empowerment and economic development.\u00a0 DCM Lamora also paid a visit to the Regional Minister of Ashanti, the Honorable Simon Osei-Mensah, with whom he discussed U.S. partnership programs in the Ashanti Region sponsored by the American people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While in Kumasi, DCM Lamora visited the EducationUSA Advising Center to discuss advising services offered to Ghanaians interested in studying in the United States.\u00a0 EducationUSA is a U.S. government network of over 425 international student advising centers in 178 countries \u2013 two of which are in Ghana (Accra and Kumasi). Both promote U.S. higher education to students by offering accurate, comprehensive, and current information about opportunities to study at accredited post-secondary institutions in the United States.\u00a0 For more information, visit <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/education-culture\/educationusa-center\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/education-culture\/educationusa-center\/<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ejura, Mampong, and Kumasi, GHANA \u2013 U.S. Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM) Christopher J.
