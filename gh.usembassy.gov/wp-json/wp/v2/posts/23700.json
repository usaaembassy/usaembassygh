Their achievements were formally recognized through the remarks and presentation of certificates of completion by the Honorable Mavis Hawa Koomson, the Minister for Fisheries and Aquaculture Development, Ms. Grace Lang, the USAID\/Ghana Deputy Mission Director, and the Honorable Dr. Kwabena Okyere Darko Mensah, Western Regional Minister.<\/p>\n<p>Ghana is currently facing steep declines in fish stocks and catches, leading to increased economic hardship for coastal fishing communities. \u00a0This requires interventions aimed at equipping communities with supplemental livelihoods to reduce their vulnerabilities to these environmental and economic shocks. \u00a0A USAID study in December 2022 found that only 19% of fisherfolks in coastal communities engaged in supplemental livelihoods.<\/p>\n<p>To address this issue, USAID worked in alignment with the Government of Ghana\u2019s skills development initiatives to promote the supplementary livelihoods program, which provides technical and vocational education for coastal youth, ages 15 \u2013 35.\u00a0 Participants were also trained in financial literacy and entrepreneurship, and given start-up tool kits to encourage success during and after their apprenticeships.<\/p>\n<p>USAID, in partnership with the Ministry and Fisheries Commission, plans to scale up this supplemental livelihood opportunity over the next year by enrolling an additional 3,500 individuals in the program.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>About USAID<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong><em>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is the lead U.S. Government agency that works to end extreme global poverty and enable resilient, democratic societies to realize their potential.
