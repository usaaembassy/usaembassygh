make people think about current trade practices at the ports; and spur citizens to ask some hard questions of themselves and their government officials.<\/p>\n<p>Ghana has tremendous potential to be \u201cthe trade gateway of Africa.\u201d\u00a0 The United States will work with you to create an enabling business environment that builds on your economic and political stability and creates jobs for the citizens of both our countries.\u00a0 But the choice is ultimately up to the government and people of Ghana: \u00a0what do you want the future of Ghana to be?<\/p>\n<p>Thank you very much.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning.\u00a0 I am delighted to be here with so many business leaders, who are doing so much to strengthen commercial ties between America and Ghana.\u00a0 Thank you to the Ministry of Trade and Industry for being a staunch partner in the quest to facilitate trade between our countries and to make Ghana more competitive &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1058,"featured_media":17742,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_gpalab_slo_mission_select":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[4,7,10,3996,54,1161,4007],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-17741","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-ambassador","category-business","category-commercial-affairs","category-economic-issues","category-speeches","category-trade","category-usaid"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Remarks by Amb.
