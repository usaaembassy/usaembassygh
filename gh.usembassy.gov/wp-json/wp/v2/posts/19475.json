Sullivan honored Ms. Stella Saaka, from the Talensi district in the Upper East Region, with the U.S. Embassy\u2019s 2019 Ghana Woman of Courage Award during a breakfast ceremony hosted at the Ambassador\u2019s residence.\u00a0 Like the U.S. Secretary of State&#8217;s annual International Women of Courage Award, this award recognizes a Ghanaian woman whose efforts have exemplified exceptional courage and leadership in advocating for human rights, women\u2019s equality, and social progress, often at great personal risk.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Minister of Gender, Children and Social Protection, Cynthia Morrison, attended the event, as did Chiefs of Mission and High Commissioners or their representatives from 16 diplomatic missions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">The International Women of Courage Award is the only Department of State award that pays tribute to emerging women leaders worldwide, in the manner that the U.S. Embassy\u2019s Woman of Courage Award recognizes emerging women leaders in Ghana.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Stella\u00a0Saaka is a powerful force for women\u2019s rights in the Talensi District in northern Ghana.\u00a0 She is the Regional Organizing Secretary for the Women in Agricultural Platforms (WAPs), a key component of U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)\u2019s Northern Ghana Governance Activity.\u00a0 In addition to spearheading agricultural income-generating activities for women, Ms. Saaka continues to break barriers in the male-dominated political and traditional authority system prevalent in northern Ghana, convincing the Talensi political leadership to include women in the district\u2019s development and decision-making process.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">While presenting the award to Ms. Saaka, Ambassador Sullivan said; \u201cStella\u2019s actions actively empower the women in her community by helping them to access productive resources and to ensure their voices are heard by decision makers.\u00a0 Her students call her a role model and the women she represents call her a woman of courage.\u00a0 I hope that all Ghanaian women and girls learn about her story, so they can craft their own journey to make a difference.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Accepting her award, Ms. Saaka said, \u201cI am happy that my work with women in rural Talensi has been recognized by the U.S. Mission in Ghana.\u00a0 I dedicate this award to all my hard working women in Talensi and to all women working hard to empower themselves economically to take care of their families and homes in Ghana.\u201d\u00a0 In describing her approach to working with the local authorities on behalf of women, Stella said, \u201cI come in peace but I mean business.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ms. Saaka has distinguished herself among USAID\u2019s Northern Ghana Governance Activity participants, who aim to address the broad issue of access to land in one of the most densely populated districts in the region per square area.\u00a0 Foreseeing an opportunity for women to gain access to land, she was the only woman who successfully addressed long-held traditional customs by involving local chiefs and generating the conversation on why it is important for women to have access to land to generate economic development. \u00a0This is significant because land tenure consists of a layered system of traditional tribal ownership that has historically disenfranchised women.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ms. Saaka\u2019s determination and persistence were rewarded when the Chief of Tongo allocated 29 acres of land to 30 women in the district.\u00a0 She and the women started working on post-harvest processing and income-generating activities with sweet potatoes, peanuts, and other agricultural products. Ms. Saaka started processing sweet potatoes in 2014, and the women use the income they generate to support their children\u2019s education.\u00a0 As a means of alternative income generation, they produce a range of products from the orange sweet potato, including drinks, snacks, and flour for making pastries.\u00a0 Due to these efforts, more women are finding ways to contribute to the economy in the district, which has led to a decrease in female migration during the dry season.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Another area where Ms. Saaka stands out is in her civic engagement.\u00a0 Specifically, she convinced the Talensi traditional leadership to include women in the district\u2019s development and decision-making process.\u00a0 As a result, she and her WAP colleagues represent their district at the assembly\u2019s Medium Term Development Planning sessions, which affords these women an opportunity to contribute to their own advancement.\u00a0 Because of their advocacy, the district assembly and traditional and political authorities have now prioritized land tenure security for women, the provision of a tractor for women, and training for female tractor operators.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ms. Stella Saaka wears many hats in her community: she is a mother, a teacher, an entrepreneur, a women\u2019s leader, and a community icon.\u00a0 Her lifetime achievements exemplified by her resilience and courage set an example for all Ghanaians, especially women and girls.<\/p>\n<p>Read the Ambassador\u2019s full remarks below.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Remarks for International Women of Courage Ceremony<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>\u201cHonoring U.S. Mission Accra\u2019s 2019 Woman of Courage Nominee, Stella Saaka\u201d<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>March 26, 2019<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Honorable Minister of Gender, Children and Social Protection of Ghana,<br \/>\nHonorable Cynthia Morrison;<br \/>\nHonorable Minister for Food and Agriculture, Honorable Owusu Afriyie Akoto;<br \/>\nHonorable Minister for Local Government and Rural Development, Honorable Hajia Alima Mahama;<br \/>\nRepresentatives of international organizations;<br \/>\nMembers of the media;<br \/>\nDistinguished ladies and gentlemen;<br \/>\nAll protocols observed.<\/p>\n<p>This morning we honor the highest traits of citizenship and courage, exemplified in the life of Ms. Stella Saaka, on whom the United States is proud to bestow our Woman of Courage Award for Ghana this year.<\/p>\n<p>I am deeply honored by your presence at today\u2019s breakfast gathering to honor her achievements. I have always said that to truly promote women\u2019s rights, we have to start by recognizing and celebrating the extraordinary achievements of women.<\/p>\n<p>I would like to tell you a bit more about the Secretary of State\u2019s International Women of Courage Award. Now in its 13th year, this award recognizes women around the globe who have demonstrated exceptional courage and leadership in advocating for peace, justice, human rights, gender equality, and women\u2019s<br \/>\nempowerment, often at great personal risk and sacrifice. \u00a0Since the inception of this award in March 2007, the State Department has recognized more than 120 women from more than 65 different countries.\u00a0 This year\u2019s 10 finalists were recognized by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and First Lady Melania Trump at a ceremony on March 7 th at the Department of State in Washington, D.C. The finalists from sub- Saharan Africa include an anti-terror investigator from Djibouti who has put away numerous al-Shabaab terrorists and a Tanzanian lawyer who fights for human rights for women and girls and advocates for more female candidates for public office.<\/p>\n<p>Each year, U.S. diplomatic missions overseas may nominate only one woman of courage from their respective host countries.\u00a0 That only 10 finalists can be selected worldwide in no way diminishes the exemplary achievements of all of the nominees. As Secretary Pompeo stated in his remarks, \u201cWe\u2019re here today to honor women of courage from all around the world who are standing tall in the face of extraordinary adversity. Women of courage exist everywhere, they\u2019re needed everywhere. Most will never be honored.\u201d I agree with Secretary Pompeo\u2019s assessment that too often women\u2019s achievements are overlooked or not recognized, which is why it was so important for me and all of us to personally to recognize Stella today.<\/p>\n<p>Women\u2019s economic empowerment is a key component of the U.S. government\u2019s dedication to advancing gender equality. The untapped potential of women remains a lost opportunity for economic growth and development the world can ill afford. Women\u2019s economic participation promotes agricultural productivity; enterprise development at the micro, small, and medium enterprise levels; and business management and returns on investment.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to boosting economic growth, investing in women produces a multiplier effect: women reinvest a large portion of their income in their families and communities. They also play key roles in creating peaceful and stable societies, important factors for economic growth.<\/p>\n<p>With that said, I would now like to invite Stella to join me at the podium while I tell you a bit more about the reasons why our Embassy nominated her for this award. Stella please come forward.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stella is a powerful force for women\u2019s rights in the Talensi district in the Upper East region.\u00a0 In a region where land is granted through patriarchal inheritance, Stella succeeded in persuading the local Chief to allocate 29 acres of land to 30 women in the district.\u00a0 Access to the land for these women is a significant breakthrough bringing positive changes to their lives.<\/li>\n<li>She is the Regional Organizing Secretary for \u201cWomen in Agricultural Platforms,\u201d a key component of our Northern Ghana Governance Activity through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).\u00a0 In this position Stella represents more than 1,170 women across several platforms, engaging political and traditional authorities on acquisition of productive lands and resources for women-led agricultural production.<\/li>\n<li>She is an exemplary leader who stands out among USAID\u2019s Northern Ghana Governance Activity participants.\u00a0 The activity aims to address the broad issue of access to land in one of the most densely populated districts in the region per square area.\u00a0 Seeing an opportunity for women to gain access to land, Stella was the only woman who pushed the boundaries and long-held traditional customs by involving local chiefs and sparking the conversation on why it\u2019s so important for women to have access to land. This is significant because land tenure consists of a layered system of traditional tribal ownership that has historically marginalized women.<\/li>\n<li>Another area where Stella stands out is in her civic engagement. Specifically, she convinced the Talensi leadership to include women in the district\u2019s development and decision-making process. As a result, Stella and her Women in Agricultural Platform colleagues represent their district at the assembly\u2019s Medium Term Development Planning sessions, which affords these women an opportunity to contribute to their own advancement. Through their advocacy, land tenure security for women, the provision of a tractor for women, and training for female tractor operators are now priorities for the district assembly and traditional and political authorities.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These are but a few highlights of Stella\u2019s remarkable record of achievement on behalf of improving lives in her district \u2013 not just for women \u2013 but for the families those women support. Stella\u2019s accomplishments facilitated the U.S. Embassy\u2019s recognition for what has been obvious to her community for a long time \u2013 that she wears many hats: Stella is a mother, a teacher, an entrepreneur, a women\u2019s leader, and a community icon.\u00a0 Her actions actively empower the women in her community by helping them to access productive resources and to ensure their voices are heard by decision makers. Her students call her a role model and the women she represents call her a woman of courage.\u00a0 I hope that all Ghanaian women and girls learn about her story, so they can craft their own journey to make a difference.<\/p>\n<p>Stella \u2013 today the U.S. Embassy also recognizes you as our Ghanaian Woman of Courage. It is my honor to present you with this award and certificate that states:<\/p>\n<p>The Embassy of the United States presents the 2019 Woman of Courage award to Stella Saaka in recognition of her resiliency in promoting the voice of women in decision-making and enhancing their economic well-being in Northern Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>Congratulations!<\/p>\n<p>It is my pleasure to now introduce U.S. Embassy Ghana\u2019s 2019 Woman of Courage: Stella Saaka.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Accra, GHANA\u00a0\u2014 U.S. Ambassador Stephanie S.
