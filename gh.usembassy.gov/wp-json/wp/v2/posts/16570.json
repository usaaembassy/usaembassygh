The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fvap.gov\/citizen-voter\/registration-ballots\">FPCA<\/a> is accepted by all local election officials in all U.S. states and territories.<\/p>\n<p>You can complete the FPCA <strong>online <\/strong>at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fvap.gov\/\">FVAP.gov<\/a>. The online voting assistant will ask you questions specific to your state. We encourage you to ask your local election officials to deliver your blank ballots to you electronically (by email, internet download, or fax, depending on your state). Include your email address on your FPCA to take advantage of the electronic ballot delivery option. Return the FPCA per the instructions on the website. FVAP.gov will tell you if your state allows the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fvap.gov\/citizen-voter\/registration-ballots\">FPCA<\/a> to be returned electronically or if you must submit a paper copy with original signature. If you must return a paper version, please see below for mailing options.<\/p>\n<p>2. <strong>Receive and Complete Your Ballot: <\/strong>States are required to send out ballots 45 days before a regular election for federal office and states generally send out ballots at least 30 days before primary elections. For most states, you can confirm your <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fvap.gov\/links\">registration and ballot delivery online<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>3. <strong>Return Your Completed Ballot: <\/strong>Some states allow you to return your completed ballot electronically and others do not. If your state requires you to return paper voting forms or ballots to local election officials, you can do so free of charge at the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. <strong>Place your ballots in postage paid return envelopes or in envelopes bearing sufficient domestic U.S. postage, and address them to the relevant local election officials.<\/strong><i><\/i><\/p>\n<p><strong>Researching the Candidates and Issues: Online Resources<\/strong>.
