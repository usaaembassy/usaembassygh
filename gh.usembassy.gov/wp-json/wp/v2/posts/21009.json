Sullivan welcomed the trade mission participants on September 1, saying, \u201cI\u2019m delighted to welcome U.S. franchises, which bring successful business strategies and some of the innovative product lines and services for which U.S. businesses are known around the globe, to Ghana.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>During the virtual trade mission, the U.S. Commercial Service arranged more than 30 meetings with Ghanaian investors via videoconference.\u00a0 \u201cThis was a very successful virtual trade mission, with enthusiastic participation from 20 Ghanaian investors interested in bringing U.S. brands to Ghanaian consumers.\u00a0 We hope to follow this up with an in-person trade mission to Ghana when travel permits,\u201d said U.S. Embassy Commercial Attach\u00e9 Hannah Kamenetsky.<\/p>\n<p>Increasing trade and strengthening the business relationships between the United States and Ghana is a top priority for the U.S. Embassy in Ghana.\u00a0 The U.S. Commercial Service helps facilitate two-way trade and investment between the United States and Ghana and provides timely, relevant, customized solutions to assist in these efforts.\u00a0 To learn more, please visit\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/gcc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com\/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgh.usembassy.gov%2Fbusiness%2Fcommercial-opportunities-ghana%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7CAhiatiC%40state.gov%7C6731b7c241ef4aa015a908d854c6fd8e%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C637352560918697996&amp;sdata=HkAW0kPvFwhEkByX8VUpdxEoKu8vkAQXtE2vZb26GTA%3D&amp;reserved=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/gcc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com\/?url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fgh.usembassy.gov%252Fbusiness%252Fcommercial-opportunities-ghana%252F%26data%3D02%257C01%257CAhiatiC%2540state.gov%257C6731b7c241ef4aa015a908d854c6fd8e%257C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%257C0%257C0%257C637352560918697996%26sdata%3DHkAW0kPvFwhEkByX8VUpdxEoKu8vkAQXtE2vZb26GTA%253D%26reserved%3D0&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1599746760046000&amp;usg=AFQjCNECVkY1UUdt_VJJPlT6zG4nDFwFOw\">https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/business\/commercial-opportunities-ghana\/<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\" align=\"center\">Read Ambassador Stephanie S.Sullivan&#8217;s remarks below.<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Remarks by Ambassador Stephanie S.

The briefing today will offer expert advice on establishing a franchise and running a successful business in Ghana, as well as provide an overview of the Ghanaian market.<\/p>\n<p>I understand that about 20 Ghanaian investors are ready and enthusiastic to meet with you virtually over the next three days and learn more about your brands. I\u2019m delighted to welcome U.S. franchises, which bring successful business strategies and some of the innovative product lines and services for which U.S. businesses are known around the globe, to Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>Under normal circumstances, I would probably be welcoming you in person at a reception in my home, where we could exchange stories and ideas while mingling and meeting new people and potential partners. However, we are meeting today on a videoconference because the global COVID-19 pandemic has changed our world. Because this is the new normal, we have to adapt.<\/p>\n<p>So, this virtual trade mission will launch conversations between you and potential franchisees over the internet that we hope will continue in person when you do have the opportunity to visit Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>And I\u2019m confident that when you do eventually make the journey, you will find it well worth the wait.\u00a0 In fact, it\u2019s my second assignment in Ghana and I couldn\u2019t wait to come back! Ghana is a beautiful country, with welcoming people and a vibrant commercial sector in which U.S. products and services do extremely well.<\/p>\n<p>Ghana\u2019s government has done its best over the last six months to fight the pandemic. It imposed a partial lockdown on major metropolitan areas for three weeks in April; land borders were closed; the country\u2019s healthcare system focused on measures to stem the spread of the virus, and local businesses pivoted to manufacture hand sanitizer and facemasks and other PPE.<\/p>\n<p>While the U.S. Embassy has been on maximum telework since March, we \u00a0continue to engage with our Ghanaian counterparts on the key pillars of our mission: boosting two-way trade and investment and inclusive, country-led enterprise-driven development; and bolstering regional security; and strengthening democracy and good governance.<\/p>\n<p>Ghana has fared better than many countries, with about 43,000 cases and a low reported mortality rate. However, the effects of the global pandemic have caused the Ghanaian economy to slow down. Pre-pandemic, Ghana\u2019s economy was among the fastest growing in the world. \u00a0It is forecast to continue to grow, but at a significantly slower pace in the near term. Thanks to some strong fundamentals, such as government investments in education, job training, and infrastructure; a young population; and a growing middle class, Ghana is expected to recover its economic vibrancy over the next couple of years.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. Embassy has worked closely with Ghana\u2019s public health officials to help fight the coronavirus and mitigate its effects on vulnerable populations, also arranging for donations of medical equipment, protective clothing, and testing kits. In fact, U.S. companies operating in Ghana have been generous with their donations to fight the virus, providing equipment, masks, protective clothing, and money\u00a0since the virus reached Ghana\u2019s shores in March.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, you can see a list of such contributions on the website of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ghana <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amchamghana.org\/covid-19-support\/\">https:\/\/www.amchamghana.org\/covid-19-support\/<\/a> .<\/p>\n<p>We look forward to welcoming new U.S. companies and brands to Ghana in the near future as a result of this virtual trade mission, taking advantage of this innovative way of conducting business during an unprecedented global challenge, in a place where personal relationships count for a lot.<\/p>\n<p>As a Ghanaian proverb says, \u201cDo not follow the path. Go where there is no path to begin a trail.\u201d *So, I welcome you to blaze a trail to new partnerships in Ghana during this virtual trade mission. The trail may be virtual, but the new relationships will be real, and, I hope, fruitful and long-lasting. I wish you success with your business meetings, and I look forward to the day when I will be able to welcome you in person to Ghana!<\/p>\n<p>And now, I\u2019ll turn it back over to our Senior Commercial Officer, Hannah Kamenetsky.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>*Boston University Pardee School of Global Studies African Studies Center list of proverbs from Ghana<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bu.edu\/africa\/outreach\/teachingresources\/specific-african-countries\/gp\/\">http:\/\/www.bu.edu\/africa\/outreach\/teachingresources\/specific-african-countries\/gp\/<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Accra,\u00a0GHANA\u2014 From September 1-3, 2020, the U.S. Embassy in Accra hosted the first-ever virtual U.S. Franchise Trade Mission to Ghana.\u00a0 Organized by the U.S. Commercial Service, the three-day virtual trade mission brought U.S. franchisors together with 20 Ghanaian investors.\u00a0 The U.S. franchisors represented a cross-section of popular U.S. brand concepts such as business services, industrial &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1058,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_gpalab_slo_mission_select":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[4,44],"tags":[7136,6774,7138,9898],"class_list":["post-21009","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-ambassador","category-press-releases","tag-ambassador-sullivan","tag-ghana-us-partnership","tag-u-s-ambassador-to-ghana","tag-us-trade-mission"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) -
