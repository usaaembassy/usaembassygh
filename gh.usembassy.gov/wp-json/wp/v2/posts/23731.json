Many of the awards tonight will honor reporting in critical areas such as governance, corruption, human rights, and peace and security \u2013 reporting that has made a difference.<\/p>\n<p>Journalists have an important role to play in reporting on corruption, human rights, governance, and peace and security.<\/p>\n<p>Press freedom is not just being able to write a good story, it\u2019s about the journalists who risk their safety to uncover the truth, the editors who uphold ethical standards, and the media organizations that support investigative reporting. \u00a0It is also about the citizens who read, listen, watch, and think about what you are reporting and, in so doing, actively participate in the democratic process.<\/p>\n<p>In the past two years, several countries across West Africa have experienced coups and other forms of democratic backsliding.\u00a0 Those setbacks were often previewed by assaults on press freedom and limits on the practice of journalism.\u00a0 We know that when journalists come under attack, democracy suffers \u2013 and sometimes grave events follow.<\/p>\n<p>Ghana has also recently experienced attacks on journalists and their reporting.\u00a0 We saw that earlier this month at UTV and again when a Citi News journalist was attacked while reporting on a political party\u2019s candidate selection.\u00a0Such attacks and violations of the law are unacceptable.\u00a0 Even when incidents appear to be isolated, they can have a chilling effect on press freedom.\u00a0 Journalists should not have to fear physical attack just for reporting the news.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, journalists also have a professional responsibility to report the facts fairly and accurately. \u00a0And to remain independent and neutral in their reporting, upholding the highest standards for reporting and ethics.\u00a0 A free press must shoulder serious responsibilities in order to merit trust and confidence.<\/p>\n<p>Ghana\u2019s constitution specifically allows for the National Media Commission to address and resolve complaints against the media.\u00a0 Vigilante acts \u2013 like invading a TV studio or attacking a reporter because you disagree with her reporting \u2013 simply are not the way to go about registering discontent with reporting that is seen as unflattering or unfair.<\/p>\n<p>Ghana must fiercely protect its hard-won press freedom and avoid legal encroachment on journalists\u2019 rights.\u00a0 Parliament is right now considering a bill that would prohibit journalists from reporting on a minority group in the future.<\/p>\n<p>It is of course up to Ghanaians and their elected government to make decisions about what laws to pass.\u00a0 But as friends we also believe it is important for us to share our perspective on matters of mutual interest.\u00a0 Read the draft bill.\u00a0 Report on it.\u00a0 It should matter to you that the bill could stop you from reporting about this group in the future. \u00a0But in the midst of emotional debate about the bill, the potential threats to press freedom \u2013 your freedom \u2013 do not seem to be well-understood.\u00a0 It is your job to report on these aspects to help people understand the dangerous precedent posed by such a bill.<\/p>\n<p>Even with some setbacks, Ghana has also made significant strides in supporting journalists.\u00a0 The Right to Information law, passed in 2019, is paying dividends.\u00a0 Investigative journalists and even community members are using the RTI to seek information and hold government and local officials accountable.\u00a0That\u2019s exactly how democracy should work.\u00a0 Information is power.\u00a0 And access to knowledge and information must be as streamlined as possible.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s where you all come in: making the essential connection between important information and the public.\u00a0 Helping the public understand important policy issues; reporting on corruption, abuse, and human rights violations.\u00a0It\u2019s with this type of reporting that governments \u2013 including my own \u2013 can respond and improve.\u00a0 Governments, including mine, make mistakes.\u00a0 A free and vibrant press helps us identify those mistakes and correct them.\u00a0 One of the best ways to quote\/unquote \u201ckeep them honest\u201d is to make them answer difficult questions, questions journalists like you \u2013 and the awardees tonight \u2013 ask every day.<\/p>\n<p>And it\u2019s that type of accountability that allows democracies to flex and thrive, allowing the government to be responsive to gaps in public services.\u00a0 When democracies address those needs, they close the gaps that enemies of democracy have used across the region to sew doubt and discord.<\/p>\n<p>Your theme tonight \u201cLeveraging Media Freedom to Sustain Democracy and Security Architecture\u201d is apt considering the fact that Ghana will go to the polls in 2024.\u00a0Your role is never more essential than when the country goes to vote. \u00a0Ghana is already in full campaign season. Your role is to report the facts as best you understand them, to ask tough questions, and get the answers Ghanaians need to cast their votes based on the best information available.\u00a0\u00a0 You are also critical to providing citizens with actionable information on how to register to vote, where to vote, when to vote, and how to analyze the issues to help voters identify their preferred candidate.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is a steadfast supporter of press freedom.\u00a0 This year, the U.S. Embassy along with media support organizations, will provide a variety of training and professional development opportunities for working journalists, focused on independent, accurate, and ethical journalistic standards.<\/p>\n<p>In just a few weeks, alongside GJA, we\u2019ll help launch a nationwide program for journalist training related to next year\u2019s elections.\u00a0 Then, with Media Foundation for West Africa, we\u2019ll support training for 100 journalists in northern Ghana focused on peace, security, and conflict resolution.\u00a0 With Dubawa, we\u2019ll once again support fact-check training for rural journalists in various regions of Ghana.\u00a0 And later this month, with the Dikan Center here in Accra, we\u2019ll welcome renowned photographer Pete Souza for a workshop with some of Ghana\u2019s most talented photojournalists.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s obvious tonight is that there is a great deal of excellent journalism taking place in Ghana.\u00a0 And a great deal of support for press freedom.<\/p>\n<p>As we celebrate the achievements of those being honored tonight, let us also remember that the work is far from over. \u00a0Democracy is not a one-time achievement; it must be protected and nurtured every day.\u00a0 Just like press freedom must be.\u00a0 Let us commit ourselves to the continued growth of an informed, engaged, and secure society in which transparency and accountability flourish.<\/p>\n<p>In closing, let me extend my thanks to GJA for this event, my warm congratulations to all awardees, and my deepest gratitude to all that stand for media freedom and democracy.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Remarks by U.S. Ambassador to Ghana Virginia Palmer The Ghana Journalists Association Awards 2023 Sunday, October 29, 2023 Ghana International Conference Centre As prepared for delivery &nbsp; It\u2019s a pleasure to be here with you, once again, to celebrate the best of Ghanaian journalism.
