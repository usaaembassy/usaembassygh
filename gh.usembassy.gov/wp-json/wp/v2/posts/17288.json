\u00a0Here among the 200 best spellers in the whole country? \u00a0Could you have imagined being here when you stood up to spell your first word at your school competition? \u00a0Could you have imagined this during the countless hours you spent studying new words? \u00a0Could you have imagined this even as your family waved good-bye to you?<\/p>\n<p>Okay, you may open your eyes now.<\/p>\n<p>Look around.\u00a0 You really are here. \u00a0All of you are here together.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ve made new friends. \u00a0You&#8217;ve learned new study methods. \u00a0And you&#8217;ve memorized so many new words! \u00a0I hope the past week together has made you feel certain that, indeed, you do belong here &#8212; here with other young people who love to learn and who love to read. \u00a0I hope you will share this love of learning in your home, at your school, and in your community<\/p>\n<p>I hope this spelling bee is a launch pad for your dreams to take shape. \u00a0You may have hopes of becoming a doctor, a teacher, a writer, a diplomat, or something else entirely. \u00a0Whatever your dream is, I am here to tell you that you will face obstacles, but you must be resilient. \u00a0That is a very important word. \u00a0R-E-S-I-L-I-E-N-T. \u00a0Resilient.<\/p>\n<p>Being resilient means that you will not give up easily.<\/p>\n<p>The inventors of the first powered airplane did not give up easily. \u00a0Their names were Wilbur Wright and Orville Wright, better known as the Wright Brothers. \u00a0In the early 1900s, they built machine after machine that failed to fly. \u00a0Each time they learned from their mistakes and improved on the last model. \u00a0Finally, they managed to build a model that could properly be called a &#8220;flying machine.&#8221;\u00a0 They had invented the first powered airplane. \u00a0I think we&#8217;re all very glad they didn&#8217;t give up the first time. \u00a0Or the second time. \u00a0Or the third, fourth, or fifth! \u00a0In the end, the Wright Brothers succeeded because they were resilient.<\/p>\n<p>I am proud to say that I did not give up easily when I faced obstacles in my own life.\u00a0 When I was in the 8<sup>th<\/sup> Grade, I read a book entitled The Ugly American, and it inspired me to become a diplomat.\u00a0 In my final year of university, I took the Foreign Service Exam.\u00a0 I passed the written portion, but I failed the orals.\u00a0 I did not give up though.\u00a0 Two years later, I took the exams again and embarked on an amazing career in diplomacy almost exactly 35 years ago.<\/p>\n<p>And I can give many other examples showing that resilience is a key ingredient of success.<\/p>\n<p>And be aware that your success will inspire others \u2014 in your family, or your town, your school or your village. \u00a0When astronaut Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon, he carried with him, in tribute to the Wright brothers, a small swatch of the material used in a wing of their 1903 flying machine.\u00a0 One great first inspired another great first.<\/p>\n<p>I wish you the very best in the final competition tomorrow. \u00a0Regardless of the result, you will have wonderful stories to share with your family and friends when you return home. \u00a0Whether you come from a big city or a small village, from the coast or from the savannah, I know that you will find a way to keep reading, keep learning, and keep dreaming.<\/p>\n<p>Good luck, spellers!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; Dear spellers, good morning!
