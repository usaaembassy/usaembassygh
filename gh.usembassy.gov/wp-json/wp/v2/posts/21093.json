women currently make up 50 percent of the world\u2019s population and 40 percent of the global workforce yet own only about one percent of the world\u2019s wealth.\u00a0 Programs like AWE and other U.S. government exchange programs such as the African Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship Program and the Fortune program seek to close this gap and to help women worldwide build wealth.<\/p>\n<p>We also all know that when women succeed, children are healthy and educated, and communities thrive.\u00a0 This principle is at the heart of the AWE program.\u00a0\u00a0 Designed for busy working women, AWE is a facilitated online course divided into 13 modules.\u00a0 Participants complete one module per week and \u201cgather\u201d once weekly to attend a session facilitated by trainers and subject matter experts.<\/p>\n<p>The core curriculum of AWE is an online course called DreamBuilder.\u00a0 This course has already been successful in helping women in the United States and 63 countries around the world create their own business plans, build networks of successful business owners, increase understanding of how to raise capital, and more.<\/p>\n<p>Through DreamBuilder, AWE works to achieve three goals:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Provide online education resources,<\/li>\n<li>Foster networks that support access to mentorships, and<\/li>\n<li>Connect women through existing exchange programs.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I\u2019m delighted that AWE continues to be run through the YALI RLC.\u00a0 There are so many wonderful connections between YALI and AWE. As an example, YALI can bring together AWE participants with successful young entrepreneurs.\u00a0\u00a0 This is an ideal partnership that can lead to networking, mentorship, and even collaboration opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>In her remarks for the AWE Cohort One graduation ceremony in November 2019, Ambassador Sullivan noted, \u201cAs many busy working women can attest \u2013 time is a precious commodity \u2013 and I commend all of you here today &#8211; our AWE Cohort One participants \u2013 for taking the time and investing it where it counts \u2013 in yourself!\u00a0 I am confident you will see this decision pay off in the near future.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 So AWE Cohort Two \u2013 congratulations to all of you for also taking this step to invest in yourself!<\/p>\n<p>I would like to thank in advance the many alumnae of U.S. State Department exchange programs for facilitating AWE sessions and becoming mentors to the next generation of women entrepreneurs.<\/p>\n<p>In closing, allow me to congratulate you all again on being selected for this AWEsome program!\u00a0 Together with you, we aim to create an ecosystem that can help thousands of women become successful entrepreneurs, here in Ghana and across the globe, as a means to create a safer and more prosperous world.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Counselor for Public Affairs Virginia Elliott\u2019s Remarks Academy of Women Entrepreneurs (AWE) Virtual Launch of Phase Two September 22, 2020 2:00p.m. \u2013 4:00p.m. Good afternoon!\u00a0 Thank you Mrs. Shola Safo-Duodo\u00a0for your kind introduction and thank you to the team at the Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI) Regional Leadership Center (RLC) for hosting this virtual launch &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1058,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_gpalab_slo_mission_select":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[19,3998,45,48,54,57],"tags":[9906],"class_list":["post-21093","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-education","category-gender-issues","category-public-affairs","category-scholarships-and-exchanges","category-speeches","category-success-stories","tag-academy-of-women-entrepreneurs-awe"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) -
