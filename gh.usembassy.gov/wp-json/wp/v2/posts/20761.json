DuBois Center in Accra. Many of us watched the moving memorial services in the United States, and it is comforting to have a ceremony here as well.<\/p>\n<p>We appreciate the statement delivered to the Embassy on behalf of the Universal Pan African Diaspora Coalition of Ghana on Monday, June 1, and have faithfully communicated the message to Washington, D.C.<\/p>\n<p>I take particular note of the Coalition\u2019s expression of solidarity and its \u201csharing of every dimension of the pain, trauma, despair and promise of this moment.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020, has filled with grief the hearts of Americans, Ghanaians, and people around the world.\u00a0 On behalf of the United States Embassy in Accra, I join in expressing our outrage as well as our condolences to Mr. Floyd\u2019s family and friends.<\/p>\n<p>One former police officer has been charged with second-degree murder, and three former police officers have been charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder. The cases are under investigation by state and federal authorities.\u00a0 And Attorney General Bill Barr has announced a federal civil rights investigation into George Floyd\u2019s death.<\/p>\n<p>No one is above the law.<\/p>\n<p>We have seen the difficult images across our country triggered by the horrifying events in Minnesota.\u00a0 This incident is prompting important and necessary conversations in the United States, and serves as a reminder of the importance of confronting painful truths head on, and of addressing the underlying conditions and existing systems that perpetuate racial injustice as we, as Americans, strive to form a more perfect union.<\/p>\n<p>And although our laws provide protections against racial discrimination, discrimination and the legacy of slavery are an unfortunate part of the United States\u2019 history and an all-too-present reality for many Americans.\u00a0 The U.S. Constitution expressly protects the right of peaceable assembly and to petition for a redress of grievances.\u00a0 Throughout American history, our people have gathered peacefully to protest injustice and to demand accountability from our leaders and to effect change.\u00a0 All individuals are entitled by U.S. law to gather peacefully to express their outrage over police misconduct, to call for change, and to demand accountability.<\/p>\n<p>Though these challenges are difficult to address, the United States and free and open societies around the world are strengthened through the debates produced by our citizens exercising their right to free speech. And they are held accountable through freedom of the press and rule of law.\u00a0 Governments that take human rights seriously are transparent and welcome conversations, however painful they may be, about addressing concerns and making improvements.<\/p>\n<p>I am heartened by the perspective of civil rights activist and Congressman John Lewis, who was right here with us at the Dubois Center, last July.\u00a0 And this gets to the \u201cpromise of this moment\u201d articulated in the petition of the Universal Pan African Diaspora Coalition of Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking yesterday on national television, Representative Lewis said the widespread outpouring since Mr. Floyd&#8217;s death \u201cfeels and looks so different\u201d than in the past. \u201cIt is so much more massive and all inclusive. To see people from all over the world taking to the streets, to the roadways, to stand up, to speak up, to speak out.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBecause of the action of young and old, black, white, Latino, Asian American and Native American, because people cried and prayed, people would never, ever forget what happened and how it happened.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt is my hope that we are on our way to greater change. To respect the dignity and worth of every human being, and it doesn\u2019t matter the color, or their background, or whether they\u2019re male or female, gay or straight,\u201d he concluded. \u201cWe are one people. We\u2019re one family. We all live in the same house, not just the American house, but the world house.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>You cannot stop the call of history,\u201d Lewis added. \u201cThere cannot be any turning back. We have come too far and made too much progress to stop now and go back.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, we can, and we must, do better in living up to the ideals of our national motto, inscribed on the Great Seal of the United States, E pluribus unum, Out of many, one.<\/p>\n<p>May George Floyd rest in peace and may his horrific killing help the United States on our path towards a more perfect union.<\/p>\n<p>With deep respect, I thank you for including me in today\u2019s ceremony.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ambassador Stephanie S.
