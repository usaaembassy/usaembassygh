Don\u2019t fall into that trap.\u00a0 Consider the risk to your credibility and to that of your media house, if you don\u2019t get the story right!\u00a0 Consider the way a rushed story or headline could mislead the public and negatively affect the debate on important topics.<\/p>\n<p>For example, in the COVID era, journalists like you all played a crucial role in explaining the mitigation measures the public could take to protect itself.\u00a0 You continue to play a key role to report the facts and dispel myths about COVID-19 vaccines.\u00a0 We know that vaccines are the single most effective measure we can take to combat the spread of the pandemic, and the media is well placed to inform the public about the availability and safety of COVID 19 vaccines. \u00a0Your factual reporting will ensure more people get vaccinated, as together, we race against the emergence of a potentially more virulent mutation of the virus.\u00a0 Vaccine hesitancy persists in the United States, and we are working on that.\u00a0 Meanwhile, we want to see the 43 million vaccine doses the United States has donated to Sub-Saharan countries to date are used.<\/p>\n<p>Ghana\u2019s Right to Information law is a new tool that journalists can use to combat misinformation and accurately inform the public on topics of national interest.\u00a0 I want to acknowledge the Media Foundation for West Africa for drafting a guidebook on the RTI law that\u2019s sure to prove a useful resource.\u00a0 In the United States, the similar Freedom of Information Act (FOIA \u2013 we call it) became law in 1967 and has since driven more transparency and accountability in government.\u00a0 That\u2019s not always easy for any government to embrace, but given human nature, we know it one of the best ways to ensure good stewardship of taxpayer\u2019s dollars. We applaud Ghana\u2019s adoption of this new law, that was 20 years in the making. And we hope you, as journalists, will learn how to use it to benefit the public.<\/p>\n<p>Information is power.\u00a0 Transparency and accountability are essential to good governance and strong democracy.\u00a0 As former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louise Brandeis put it, \u201cSunlight is the best disinfectant.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In order to protect freedom of the press, journalists must be able to do their work free from intimidation, threats, or worse, violence.\u00a0 An attack on a journalist for reporting the truth is an attack on our principles.\u00a0 Our societies depend on factual reporting and reliable information to make key decisions.\u00a0 That\u2019s why the protection of journalists and of freedom of the press is so important.\u00a0 The United States monitors reports of incidents of harassment and intimidation against journalists.\u00a0 We call for crimes against journalists to be investigated and prosecuted in a timely and transparent way.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is deeply committed to freedom of the press and protection of journalists to do their work without fear or favor.\u00a0 We have multiple exchange, training, and professional development programs that benefit working members of the press.\u00a0 And more professional development for journalists leads to better journalism.\u00a0 That\u2019s good for us, all as citizens in democracies.\u00a0 Congratulations to all the nominees today.<\/p>\n<p>One more appeal on the eve of COP 26 in Glasgow: Please educate yourselves and your audiences on the existential nature of the climate crisis for all of us who inhabit planet Earth!<\/p>\n<p>Once again, thank you for your work on behalf of the people of Ghana and all of West Africa to bring more \u201csunlight\u201d \u2013 as Justice Brandeis put it \u2013 to all corners of the world.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ambassador&#8217;s Remarks at the West Africa Media Excellence Awards Swiss Spirit Alisa Hotel, North Ridge, Accra, Ghana October 22, 2021\u00a0 Good afternoon.
