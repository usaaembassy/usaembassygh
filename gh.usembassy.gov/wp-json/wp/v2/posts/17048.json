\/>\nDear partners,<br \/>\nMembers of the media,<br \/>\nColleagues,<br \/>\nOther distinguished guests,<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for the opportunity to join you here this morning.<\/p>\n<p>Today I want to speak with you about people \u2014 Millions of people around the world \u2014 More than 100,000 people in Ghana \u2014 Men, women and children \u2014 All living in slavery.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ghanaian men who are lured by the promise of good construction jobs in the Middle East, only to arrive and find themselves exploited in domestic servitude and forced prostitution.<\/li>\n<li>Young Ghanaian women who move from the northern regions down to Accra in search of work, but end up victims of sex trafficking.<\/li>\n<li>Ghanaian children like Osei, whose story is featured in this year\u2019s Trafficking in Persons Report: When he was only 6 years old, his parents gave him to a fishing master who promised to provide Osei with a fishing apprenticeship, an education and a job.\u00a0 It was a lie.\u00a0 Instead, Osei and other children worked long hours on a fishing boat, every day.\u00a0 It was not an apprenticeship, it was forced labor.\u00a0 There was no schooling.\u00a0 There was no respite from the grueling labor and the dangerous conditions.\u00a0 It was not \u201ckids just helping out their families,\u201d as some have claimed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These Ghanaians, and millions of others like them around the world, are living in slavery.\u00a0 They have names.\u00a0 They have families.\u00a0 They likely thought it was worth the risk for the promise of a better life.\u00a0 But now they are trapped in a hell of forced labor, forced servitude, and forced sex.<\/p>\n<p>Modern slavery exists all around the world, including in the United States.\u00a0 Here in Ghana, we are proud to work with the International Organization for Migration (IOM), Free the Slaves and others to eliminate trafficking, particularly in the cocoa, fishing and gold mining industries.\u00a0 These organizations are fiercely dedicated to protecting populations vulnerable to trafficking, and I personally applaud their unceasing efforts.<\/p>\n<p>However, at the end of the day, NGOs are not the ones in positions of authority.\u00a0 They cannot arrest, prosecute and convict traffickers.\u00a0 They do not have ultimate responsibility for the welfare and safety of Ghanaian citizens.\u00a0 That authority, that responsibility, rests solely with the Ghanaian government.<\/p>\n<p>Every year, in accordance with U.S. law, we examine the efforts made by governments around the world to combat the evil of slavery and the crime of trafficking.<\/p>\n<p>Secretary of State John Kerry released the 2016 Trafficking in Persons Report two weeks ago.\u00a0 In the report, Ghana was ranked as a Tier 2 Watch List country for the second year in a row.\u00a0 This means that the government of Ghana did not meet the minimum standards for preventing trafficking in persons and failed to provide evidence of increasing efforts to do so.<\/p>\n<p>While the government did carry out investigations and some publicity campaigns, last year was irrevocably marred by the complete lack of prosecutions or convictions of a single trafficker.\u00a0 The number of victims identified decreased.\u00a0 Funding for law enforcement training was inadequate.\u00a0 Funding for victim services and shelters was nonexistent.<\/p>\n<p>This is tragic for the trafficking victims who desperately need their government\u2019s help to escape slavery and to see their captors appropriately punished.\u00a0 But government inaction could have even more far-reaching consequences:\u00a0 Under U.S. law, any country designated as Tier 2 Watch List two years in a row must be automatically downgraded to Tier 3 the following year, unless the government shows sufficient progress to warrant a Tier 2 or Tier 1 ranking<\/p>\n<p>This means Ghana could be subject to a Tier 3 ranking next year.\u00a0 A Tier 3 ranking comes with restrictions on our bilateral assistance programs.\u00a0 And once again, we are talking about real people.\u00a0 I\u2019ve met women farmers who have increased their production of nutritious soya and sweet potatoes and have parlayed that success into creating village savings and loan associations.\u00a0 I\u2019ve visited communities that now have indoor toilets and clean drinking water, reducing cholera.\u00a0 I\u2019ve seen children\u2019s eyes light up as they read from brand new books, written in their native tongue.\u00a0 The improvements to their lives were a direct result of our development assistance.<\/p>\n<p>As the U.S. Ambassador to Ghana, I certainly do not want to see our assistance to millions of Ghanaians disrupted.\u00a0 I do not want to see our military cooperation and elections support go away.\u00a0 I do not want to see Ghana lose the second Millennium Challenge Compact, just as we are poised to help overcome the electricity shortage that is crippling economic growth.\u00a0 Cutting assistance is not a threat.\u00a0 It will be a fact if the Government of Ghana does not act to tackle trafficking in a far more deliberate manner.<\/p>\n<p>I commend the Ministry of Gender for announcing last week that security officers in border towns will receive training to help them identify potential child traffickers and trafficking victims.\u00a0 I commend the Ministry of Fisheries for seizing two vessels with children aboard working in dangerous conditions.\u00a0 I commend the investigators of the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU) in the Regional GPS Headquarters in Ho, Volta Region, but they need funds to get out of their offices and do their jobs.\u00a0 There are many more steps to be taken in the coming months: funding investigations and prosecutions; cracking down on fraudulent recruiting agencies; convicting and punishing traffickers; supporting and protecting those who have been victimized.\u00a0 It is a lot, but Ghana is not in an impossible position.<\/p>\n<p>Five years ago, the Bahamas was a Tier 2 Watch List Country.\u00a0 In 2013, it moved up to Tier 2.\u00a0 Last year, and again this year, the Bahamas was recognized as a Tier 1 country, reflecting the government\u2019s comprehensive efforts to prevent trafficking, prosecute offenders and protect victims. \u00a0Just two years ago, Cyprus was a Tier 2 Watch List Country.\u00a0 Last year, it moved up to Tier 2.\u00a0 This year, it achieved Tier 1 status. \u00a0It is certainly not a coincidence that an Under Secretary for National Security from the Bahamas and a police officer from Cyprus were recognized as anti-trafficking heroes by Secretary Kerry when he released this year\u2019s report.<\/p>\n<p>The Ghanaian government has an opportunity to demonstrate that it is capable of and committed to quick, decisive action, as well.\u00a0 It is possible.<\/p>\n<p>Inevitably, if you report on what I\u2019ve said today, some will respond, \u201cWho is America to talk about slavery?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Yes, slavery was once legal in America.\u00a0 That is a fact.\u00a0 It\u2019s also a fact that this was a shameful period in our history, and its repercussions are still being felt today.\u00a0 And I do mean today.<\/p>\n<p>But slavery was wrong 400 years ago, when the first indentured servants arrived in America.\u00a0 Slavery was wrong 230 years ago, when our Constitution included provisions protecting the institution.\u00a0 It was a wrong that Abraham Lincoln righted 153 years ago, when he issued the Emancipation Proclamation and freed more than 3 million people.<\/p>\n<p>We all wish that Proclamation had ended slavery in America forever, but it didn\u2019t.\u00a0 We still have human trafficking in America.\u00a0 We have modern-day slavery.\u00a0 And it is as wrong today as it ever was.\u00a0 We have a moral obligation to end it.\u00a0 That is why we take a holistic approach to combatting trafficking, bringing together multiple government agencies, the private sector, civil society, faith communities, law enforcement, academics and, of course, survivors.\u00a0 We publish the Trafficking in Persons Report because we believe we have a moral obligation to end slavery of any kind, anywhere, on this planet.<\/p>\n<p>I want to implore those of you in the media: \u00a0There are stories to be told.\u00a0 Stories that are far more powerful than anything I say up here today.<\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know if anyone from Starr FM is here this morning, but let me recognize them for a story they aired last week.\u00a0 They interviewed a young man who had been rescued from trafficking in the fishing industry on Lake Volta.\u00a0 He described children fishing in the middle of the night.\u00a0 He described children being sent down into the lake to untangle the nets, and drowning, as they themselves became entangled.<\/p>\n<p>There are stories to be told.\u00a0 Powerful stories about real people.\u00a0 There are questions to be asked.\u00a0 It is an election year.\u00a0 I will be asking those running for office what they intend to do\u2014win or lose, together, across party lines\u2014to eradicate trafficking and slavery in Ghana.\u00a0 I hope you will, too.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for your attention today.\u00a0 Thank you for everything you have done, and will do, to end the suffering of those trafficked into slavery.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Honorable Minister, Dear partners, Members of the media, Colleagues, Other distinguished guests, Thank
