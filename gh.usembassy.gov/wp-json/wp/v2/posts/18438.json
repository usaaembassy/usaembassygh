U.S. elections:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Request Your Ballot:\u00a0\u00a0<\/strong>Complete a new\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.fvap.gov\/uploads\/FVAP\/Forms\/fpca2013.pdf\">Federal Post Card Application (FPCA)<\/a>.\u00a0\u00a0<em>You\u00a0<u>must<\/u>\u00a0complete a new FPCA\u00a0<\/em><strong><em>after<\/em><\/strong><em>\u00a0January 1, 2018 to ensure you receive your ballot for the 2018 elections.<\/em><strong>\u00a0\u00a0<\/strong>The completion of the FPCA allows you to request absentee ballots for all\u00a0<strong>elections for federal offices (President, U.S. Senate, and U.S. House of Representatives)<\/strong>\u00a0including primaries and special elections during the calendar year in which it is submitted.\u00a0 The\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.fvap.gov\/citizen-voter\/registration-ballots\">FPCA<\/a>\u00a0is accepted by all local election officials in all U.S. states and territories.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">You can complete the FPCA\u00a0<strong>online\u00a0<\/strong>at\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.fvap.gov\/\">www.FVAP.gov<\/a>.\u00a0 The online voting assistant will ask you questions specific to your state.\u00a0 We encourage you to ask your local election officials to deliver your blank ballots to you electronically (by email, internet download, or fax, depending on your state).\u00a0 Include your email address on your FPCA to take advantage of the electronic ballot delivery option.\u00a0 Return the FPCA per the instructions on the website.\u00a0 FVAP.gov will tell you if your state allows the\u00a0<a

ballots 45 days before a regular election for federal office and states generally send out ballots at least 30 days before primary elections.\u00a0 For most states, you can confirm your\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.fvap.gov\/links\">registration and ballot delivery online<\/a><u>.<\/u><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Return Your Completed Ballot:\u00a0\u00a0<\/strong>Some states allow you to return your completed ballot by email or fax.\u00a0 If your state requires you to return paper voting forms or ballots to local election officials, you can use international mail, a courier service such as FedEx or DHL, or you may also drop off completed voting materials during regular business hours at the U.S. Embassy in Accra.\u00a0 Place your materials in a postage paid return envelope (available under \u201cDownloadable Election Materials\u201d on the FVAP homepage) or in an envelope bearing sufficient domestic U.S. postage, and address\u00a0it to the relevant local election officials.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>New this year \u2013 email to fax service by FVAP! &#8211;\u00a0<\/strong>the Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) will provide an
