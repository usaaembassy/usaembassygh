The World Health Organization (WHO) reports malaria is responsible for one in five deaths of African children under age 5 every year.\u00a0 According to the Washington DC-based Population Reference Bureau, malaria takes its toll not only in lives lost, but also in medical costs, lost income, and reduced economic output.\u00a0 Children miss school and suffer physically and intellectually because of the disease. The risk of malaria and malaria epidemics grows along with climate change and changes in land use associated with mining, logging, and other projects. These changes often increase the breeding sites of malaria-carrying mosquitoes, and, consequently, promote transmission of the disease.\u00a0 In addition, new mutant parasites and mosquitoes are growing resistant to medicines and insecticides.<\/p>\n<p>For all of these reasons, I am happy about this new lab, which began with the Africa Malaria Task Force (AMTF), a U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) initiative started in 2011, whose aim is to advance the global fight against malaria through capacity building programs and multi-country mil-to-mil collaboration in Africa.\u00a0 In Ghana, since its inception, the AMTF has provided comprehensive skills in malaria microscopy and medical entomology and fostered collaboration between the GAF and the National Malaria Control Program.\u00a0 Today\u2019s inauguration represents the next evolution in this significant partnership.<\/p>\n<p>Funded by the U.S. government through our Global Health Engagement Research Initiative and the Defense Health Agency (DHA), this lab will establish a combined entomology research and control program \u2013 the first of its kind in Ghana.\u00a0 The laboratory will support the Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Health\u2019s malaria control programs with mosquito surveillance, directing insecticide applications, insecticides resistance monitoring, and mapping of potential disease-causing mosquitoes.<\/p>\n<p>Using skills acquired in previous AMTF tactical training as the foundation, laboratory personnel will create a data-driven entomology program to aid in the development of durable, rapid-acting countermeasures against malaria and other mosquito or tick-borne diseases.\u00a0 This lab will also establish a regional entomology hub in West Africa from which other AMTF partners can benefit in the future.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also important to note that the U.S. government committed not only funds to this project but also brainpower.\u00a0 Project leads and key stakeholders include the world-renowned Walter Reed Army Institute of Research Emerging Infectious Disease Branch as well as the U.S. Navy Entomology Center of Excellence.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. government has long recognized malaria as a prime example of how infectious diseases affect global health security.\u00a0 The U.S. government continues to affirm its commitment to thwarting this disease.\u00a0 This is the same desire and goal we share with all of you here regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. It will take a similarly concerted global effort to combat and eventually eradicate malaria once and for all.<\/p>\n<p>Over the past two decades, the United States has provided more than $140 billion dollars in global health assistance through programs like AMTF and the U.S President\u2019s Malaria Initiative, or PMI, as well as through multilateral efforts like the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria.\u00a0 In fact, it\u2019s our decades-long commitment and leadership in this area that has ensured progress toward a malaria-free world has continued, even as we\u2019ve faced the COVID pandemic.\u00a0 PMI has invested in hundreds of millions of mosquito-killing nets and sprays, life-saving malaria tests and medicines, and heroic health workers in clinics and communities worldwide. Together with our partners, PMI has helped save 7.6 million lives and prevent 1.5 billion infections.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier this week, PMI released its 15th Annual Report, which demonstrated the significant progress the United States and Ghana have made in our partnership to fight malaria. \u00a0Ghana\u2019s efforts to sustain essential malaria services amidst the COVID-19 pandemic continue to save lives. The United States is pleased to support these efforts under PMI through U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) programs.<\/p>\n<p>It is through programs such as PMI and AMTF that the U.S. government has been able to assist in reducing the number of malaria deaths in Ghana and around the globe.\u00a0 We look forward to seeing the continued progress of our joint efforts through this new laboratory. In the words of U.S. Global Malaria Coordinator Dr. Raj Panjabi, \u201cEnding malaria matters. It matters because it builds health systems that keep us all safer, including networks of community health workers, clinics and labs that help us fight malaria while protecting us from emerging threats like COVID-19.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Together, let\u2019s end this mosquito-borne disease within this generation.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Accra,\u00a0GHANA\u2013\u00a0On April 30, 2021, U.S. Ambassador to Ghana Stephanie S.
