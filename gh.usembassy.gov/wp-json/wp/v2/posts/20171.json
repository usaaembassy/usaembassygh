I commend the efforts these cyclists have made to draw attention to the need to make Ghana\u2019s beaches pristine areas, free of plastic and other waste, and safe to enjoy as the recreational areas they truly are.To pose an often-heard question: \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d \u2013 or you \u2013 or the people of Ghana? Improved sanitation will bring positive health and economic benefits, from better nutrition and greater productivity, to increased tourism revenues.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are two sayings in Ga, \u201cNu kpapka haa wala\u201d Water is Life and \u201cfalefale feemo haa ahunyam\u201d Sanitation is Dignity. These sayings acknowledge the fundamental right of all people to safe and adequate water and sanitation. The Sustainable Development Goal is to ensure universal access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030.\u00a0 In Ghana, only 18% of people have access to safe sanitation, and 31% of the population practices open defecation.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Poor water and sanitation are responsible for over 70% of diarrheal deaths in children younger than 5 years in Ghana.\u00a0 Events like today not only protect the environment, but also help to give more children the opportunity to reach their potential and contribute to the development of their communities. Development assistance from the United States helps increase access to water, sanitation and hygiene, and builds the capacity of schools, communities, districts and committees to operate, manage, and sustain water and sanitation facilities.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We use a community-led, total sanitation approach to support the elimination of open defecation. This approach engages community members to conduct their own appraisal of areas of open defecation and define their own solutions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As a result of our support, a total of 108 communities were declared \u201cOpen Defecation Free\u201d (ODF) in 2019, bringing the total number of our target communities declared ODF to 740 in the past five years.<\/span><b>\u00a0 <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When I was here 20 years Ago, it wasn\u2019t called Open Defection but \u201cFree Ranging\u201d. So it\u2019s not a new thing \u2013 It just has a new name. I hope in 20 more years it not only won\u2019t have a new name, it won\u2019t have any more name at all because it won\u2019t be a problem anymore!\u00a0 Each household and community has the responsibility to maintain that status.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In conclusion, the United States has worked hand-in-hand with the Government and people of Ghana to help create a cleaner, healthier, and more economically viable environment. No campaign is effective without the foot-soldiers on the frontlines, who work day-in and day-out to make a difference.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I congratulate environmentalist Malik Mino Ereira and his colleagues, for they are indeed part of the solution to today\u2019s challenges leading to tomorrow\u2019s prosperity.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ambassador Sullivan\u2019s remarks at Ceremony to Protect Marine Life from Plastic Pollution\u00a0 and Open Defecation Jamestown Lighthouse In Recognition of World Toilet Day (Nov 19)\u00a0 November 16, 2019 12:00 noon Representative of the Minister of Water and Sanitation;\u00a0 Mr. Andrew Barnes, High Commissioner of Australia;\u00a0 Mr. Obed Quaye and Members of the Waste Segregation and &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1058,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_gpalab_slo_mission_select":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[4,37,54],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-20171","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-ambassador","category-news","category-speeches"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) -
