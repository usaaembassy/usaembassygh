Good morning and thank you for joining me here for breakfast today. \u00a0I\u2019m so grateful that, through the excellent leadership of your Board, we have a vibrant American Chamber of Commerce here in Ghana. \u00a0I had an excellent initial meeting with Joe and with Simon Madjie shortly after my arrival, and I was pleased to hear about the positive and productive relationship you have and have had with our Embassy team over the past decades.\u00a0 I\u2019m also impressed by the regularity and variety of programs and events you have, and I\u2019m sure this will be the first of many times that I get to see all of you as a group during my tenure here.<\/p>\n<p>The United States shares AmCham Ghana\u2019s goals to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contribute positively to overall economic stability;<\/li>\n<li>Help U.S. businesses prosper and grow;<\/li>\n<li>Increase job opportunities; and<\/li>\n<li>Encourage and promote Ghana\u2019s private enterprise system.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As many of you know, we have many programs and initiatives through the U.S. government meant to support these objectives. \u00a0Part of my job here is to connect these dots \u2013 to deepen the U.S.-Ghana relationship by connecting U.S. government programs and initiatives to people like you \u2013 people dedicated to the same vision of a Ghana with a strong economy and strong private sector advancing Ghana\u2019s development, in part via greater U.S. trade and investment.<\/p>\n<p>So today, I\u2019m happy to welcome Heather Lanigan, who has come from Washington to introduce you to one such program. \u00a0Ms. Lanigan is the sub-Saharan Africa Director at the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (or USTDA). Heather has many years of experience at USTDA and will give you a more in-depth presentation, but, by way of brief introduction, USTDA provides grant funding for feasibility studies for public or private sector infrastructure projects in middle or low-income countries around the world. \u00a0These grants help meet USTDA\u2019s dual mission of facilitating the development of sustainable infrastructure projects and supporting the use of U.S. equipment and services.<\/p>\n<p>As you all know, it can be difficult and costly to properly design major infrastructure projects. \u00a0It\u2019s important for infrastructure projects to have detailed feasibility studies to ensure that they\u2019re sized and priced properly; that the right equipment is being used; and that the proper economic, environmental, and financial analyses have been completed. \u00a0USTDA can provide grant funding to do this important analysis to help ensure successful infrastructure development and commercial deals here in Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>To provide you with one quick example, just last week I was out in Kpone (Pong) to launch an $860,000 feasibility study grant to support a U.S. company and its Ghanaian partner to build solar energy systems. \u00a0When the feasibility study is complete, these two companies will partner to install solar energy systems using solar panels manufactured in Ghana with equipment such as inverters and batteries manufactured in the United States.\u00a0 This is just one small recent example of how USTDA can leverage commercial partnerships that have an impact in support of our mutual goals.<\/p>\n<p>I hope that some of you will take advantage of this important tool, and now, I would like to welcome Heather Lanigan to speak with us in greater detail about USTDA.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome!
