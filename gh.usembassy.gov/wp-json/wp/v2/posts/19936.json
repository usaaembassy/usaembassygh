Francis K.A. Codjoe;<\/p>\n<p>Vice Provost for International Initiatives and Academic Partnerships, University of Rhode Island &#8211; Dr. Gifty Ako-Adounvo;<\/p>\n<p>Vice-Chancellor, University of Cape Coast Prof. Joseph Ghartey Ampiah;<\/p>\n<p>Director, Ghana Fisheries Commission \u2013 Mr. Michael Arthur-Dadzie;<\/p>\n<p>Chief Director, Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development \u2013 Mr. Frank Sofo;<\/p>\n<p>Members of the Press;<\/p>\n<p>Ladies and Gentlemen:<\/p>\n<p>It is a great honor and privilege to represent the United States Government at this important conference to highlight the achievements and lessons learned from our support to the fisheries sector. As we know, some ten percent of the country\u2019s population derives their livelihoods from the sector, and fish account for some 60 percent of the average Ghanaian\u2019s protein intake.\u00a0 Gatherings such as this National Fisheries Conference create the space for reflection on how all of us can cooperate to sustain the fishing sector for future generations to reap the rewards of a highly functioning industry.\u00a0 The presence of the Hon. Senior Minister today shows the importance the highest levels of the Ghanaian government places on this vital sector.<\/p>\n<p>The United States Government wants Ghana to succeed in these efforts. We see the progress made in the fisheries sector, as a continuing great example of Ghana\u2019s progress along her journey to self-reliance.\u00a0 I want to express my profound gratitude to the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development, the Fisheries Commission, and the Ghanaian people for their partnership and collaboration in achieving successes in the sector, including implementing a closed season this year.<\/p>\n<p>Other notable successes include the greater use of scientific data to make informed decisions, strengthened stakeholder engagement, an improved policy environment, and an increased role for community members in making management decisions.<\/p>\n<p>The last of these has proven transformational in allowing citizens to assume a greater role in partnering with the government to devise and implement mutually agreed-upon solutions.\u00a0 Greater community involvement is key to ensuring that people buy into national plans and can influence their own development paths.<\/p>\n<p>Ghana needs the support of all of its stakeholders, from the government and universities to the private sector and citizens themselves, to progress along that path.\u00a0 The U.S. Government\u2019s \u201cJourney to Self-Reliance\u201d initiative for countries to plan, resource, and manage their own national development entails a similar approach.\u00a0 Together, we can help put in place the necessary structures and processes to consolidate the gains we\u2019ve made in the fisheries sector over the past five years.<\/p>\n<p>One continuing challenge that will require sustained political will and stakeholder engagement is the need to implement the closed fishing seasons on an annual basis \u2013 absent this commitment, the sacrifices and gains of the closed seasons are all for naught.\u00a0 We recognize the sacrifices made by community members who must find another way to make a living during closed seasons in order to provide for their families and we must continue work. Together we must create disincentives and enforce against illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing operations including saiko fishing, all of which threaten to drive the fisheries sector into collapse.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. Government will continue to collaborate and provide technical assistance to revamp and reinvigorate the fisheries sector and put Ghana\u2019s fisheries on the path of sustainability and profitability.\u00a0 Thanks to all of you for your participation in this week\u2019s conference. Together, we can make a difference for millions of Ghanaians.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">################<\/p>\n<p><strong>About USAID<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>USAID is the lead U.S. Government agency that works to end extreme global poverty and enable resilient, democratic societies to realize their potential.
