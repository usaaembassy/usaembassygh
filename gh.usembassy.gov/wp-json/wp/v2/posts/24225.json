S. Amegashie Auditorium, University of Ghana<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Friday, June 28, 2024, 10:00 a.m. -12:00 p.m<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>*Remarks as Prepared*<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a great honor to join this impressive group of experts, public health leaders, and students today at the University of Ghana. Thanks to my friend Gideon Owusu for the invitation. I understand there are 1,000 student health professionals from 13 top universities in Ghana here with us today. I can feel the energy in the room! Who better to come together to tackle the formidable challenge of malaria control and elimination, than the best and brightest minds this great country has to offer.<\/p>\n<p>For almost 20 years &#8211; since 2006 &#8211; the United States Government has partnered with Ghana to eliminate malaria. Malaria is both preventable and treatable. There is no reason for it to take as heavy a toll as it does on Ghana\u2019s development &#8212; on the health of all Ghanaians, but also on its economic resilience. Children miss school, farmers and teachers can\u2019t work. And despite the availability of free malaria prevention and treatment options, many children still die from this preventable disease.<\/p>\n<p>Today, I would like to make two brief points on the elimination of malaria in Ghana:<br \/>\nFirst: on the impact of climate change; and<br \/>\nSecond: on the significant role of youth.<\/p>\n<p>Over the past 18 years, we have contributed over $460 million U.S. dollars \u2013 6.9 billion Ghana Cedis \u2013 to support the development and implementation of a national strategy to combat malaria based on the best science available. The U.S. President\u2019s Malaria Initiative, or PMI, has procured over 27 million mosquito nets, 36 million malaria rapid diagnostic tests, and over 13 million preventive malaria treatments for Ghanaians. We have also collaborated with the Ghana Health Service National Malaria Elimination Program, local academic centers of excellence like the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research right here at the University of Ghana, and local pharmaceutical manufacturing companies.<\/p>\n<p>Through these collaborations and support, the prevalence of malaria among children under five has plummeted from 27.5% in 2011 to 8.6% in 2022.<\/p>\n<p>These results were achieved not just with drugs and treatment but because community leaders including chiefs, queen mothers, parents, and youth, mobilized to encourage sleeping under bed nets, testing, and seeking prompt treatment, and ensuring the most vulnerable groups &#8211; pregnant women and children under five years old &#8211; take preventive malaria treatment during the rainy season.<\/p>\n<p>With global warming, we are seeing weather patterns change \u2013 longer and unpredictable rainy seasons, and increasing temperatures. A warmer world means mosquitoes can live longer and, in more places, increasing the spread of malaria. In areas where year round temperatures have been cool and where mosquitoes did not generally thrive, we are now seeing an increasing prevalence of malaria.<\/p>\n<p>Here in Ghana, as a result of climate change, the rainy season up North is longer, therefore preventive malaria treatment is administered for five months instead of the usual three months. This has significantly increased the cost and effort needed for life saving prevention.<\/p>\n<p>We need to be able to adapt to these changes, work smart and strategically to protect ourselves and our children. We need new malaria prevention tools, treatment medicines, protocols and more money.<br \/>\nI also want to emphasize the role of youth in achieving zero malaria. As future leaders, you hold immense power to bring about lasting solutions. Your energy, creativity, and passion are invaluable assets in our fight against malaria. This symposium proves that Ghanaian youth are engaged, ready to work hard and want to be part of the solution. You are the Generation To End Malaria!<\/p>\n<p>Involving youth in the malaria response is not just a matter of principle or something that is \u201cnice to have,\u201d it is a matter of necessity. You have a role to play in Ghana\u2019s malaria elimination plan &#8211; right from the top echelons of government to the community. I encourage you to continue to educate yourselves, be aware of opportunities in the public and private sector to eliminate malaria, and hold yourselves and others accountable to stay the course.<\/p>\n<p>Ghana has done well, but the fight is not over. We need to think about how we are going to manage climate change, raise the needed financing, and leverage the use of technology and science to end malaria. While we face these larger challenges, we must also hold ourselves accountable to proactively move forward with things that are within our manageable control. I will highlight two actions important now for Ghana\u2019s success &#8211; first, rapid customs clearance and distribution across the country of donated malaria commodities like malaria test kits, antimalarials, and bed nets. Second, continued prioritization of domestic financing for improving primary health care access and quality for all Ghanaians.<\/p>\n<p>Per the recent news, the Ministers of Health and Finance have facilitated the customs clearance of the $45 million worth of Global Fund donated HIV, TB and Malaria commodities sitting at the Tema port since mid 2023. But, due to logistical challenges it will take at least two more weeks before these commodities can be distributed to those who need them most &#8211; mothers, children and the sick. The customs clearance process has taken over a year. While the containers were sitting at the port, Ghana ran out of malaria test kits and other life saving medicines like the ones we use to treat tuberculosis. Bed nets used to prevent malaria transmission are also in these containers. I call upon the Government of Ghana to take this situation very seriously and conduct an after action review to resolve the bottlenecks that caused this delay. This can not happen again.<\/p>\n<p>I would like to acknowledge my colleagues from the Government of Ghana, civil society, the private sector, the youth, and all the citizens of Ghana, for stepping up to this ambitious but necessary call to action of eliminating malaria in<\/p>\n<p>Ghana. Let us work together in partnership for a malaria-free Ghana.<br \/>\nThank you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Scientific Conference for Malaria Elimination at R. S.
