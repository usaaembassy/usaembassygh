Now, there are many food delivery options,but Domino\u2019s was a real trailblazer in delivery service.<\/p>\n<p>Over the past 64 years, the United States has worked together with Ghanaians to develop our bilateral relationship, including to strengthen two-way trade and investment.<\/p>\n<p>The opening of this franchise and the one in Osu, closer to my residence, represent the ideal of that partnership, bringing together a U.S. brand and local investors to serve up a slice \u2013 or two \u2013 of goodness.<\/p>\n<p>American brands and franchises are rapidly expanding to new markets all over the world, fueling job growth at home and abroad.<\/p>\n<p>And Ghana\u2019s political stability, security, and its new role as the host of the African Continental Free Trade Area Secretariat are enticing for more and more U.S. companies. In fact, most of us saw the news on Monday that another U.S. company, technology giant Twitter, will make Ghana its new African headquarters and is already advertising for new jobs here.<\/p>\n<p>In making the announcement, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey specifically mentioned Ghana\u2019s support for free speech and free trade as vital to his company\u2019s decision.<\/p>\n<p>Many U.S. brands have enjoyed tremendous success here in Ghana in recent years, many more since my previous assignment here twenty years ago, ranging from friendly competitors in the food industry like KFC, Burger King, and Pinkberry to services and manufacturing firms like PwC, Avis Rent-a-Car, and Cummins to name a few.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m confident that Domino\u2019s new branches in Accra will see similar success \u2013 particularly from the enthusiasm of today\u2019s crowd.<\/p>\n<p>I know I\u2019ll be a regular customer!<\/p>\n<p>Before I conclude, let me just say that it truly is a joy for me to participate in events like this.\u00a0 My team and I at the U.S. Embassy work tirelessly with Ghanaian government officials and private sector businesswomen and men to enhance Ghana\u2019s investment climate and make it an even more appetizing destination for U.S. companies.<\/p>\n<p>I am pleased to see the start of a new American brand here, one that not only delivers a tasty product to Ghanaian consumers but also creates local employment opportunities and supports inclusive economic growth.<\/p>\n<p>In light of the pandemic over the past year, I\u2019m encouraged by this launch of Domino\u2019s Pizza\u2019s, that we are starting to turn the corner to revived economic growth here in Ghana. But of course it is still crucial for us to continue observing all covid-19 protocols!<\/p>\n<p>Thank you again for inviting me to be a part of this outdooring.\u00a0 I know you have exciting expansion plans for Ghana, and I look forward to being there for your next branch opening in Kumasi or Takoradi \u2013 no pressure!<\/p>\n<p>Congratulations to Domino\u2019s Pizza.\u00a0 And, congratulations to Fire Foods Africa on this milestone investment.\u00a0 However you slice it, I\u2019m confident Ghanaian consumers will come to love the quality of Domino\u2019s Pizza\u2019s products and services as much as I have.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mr. Karan Kapur, Executive Director of Fire Foods Africa (Master Franchisee of Domino\u2019s Pizza Ghana): Mr. Vikas Singh, Managing Director of Fareast Mercantile Company \/ and Chanrai Summit Group (Ghanaian Joint Venture Partner of Fire Foods Africa) All protocols observed.
