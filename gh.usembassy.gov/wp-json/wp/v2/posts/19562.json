How\u2019s it going? That was an interesting film we just saw! It\u2019s a great pleasure to be here at the West Hills Mall for my first time for the premier of the fifth season of You Only Live Once, or YOLO.<\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t have to tell you\u00a0that this is one of Ghana\u2019s most popular shows.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to share with you a fun fact about the United States Ambassador to Ghana, Ama Mansah, that not many people know. I had a very brief theatrical career in secondary school.\u00a0 I played the role of the school nurse in a play called \u201cUp the Down Staircase.\u201d I still remember my one line: \u201cDiet. Nutrition. Make sure to eat a good breakfast!\u201d That timeless advice fits very well with the positive health message of YOLO.<\/p>\n<p>This program is a great example of the commitment the United States and Ghana share to improving the health and well-being of the world\u2019s greatest resource \u2013our youth. Evidence shows that young people do not have ready access to health information and services, including on reproductive health behaviors.<\/p>\n<p>To close that information gap, the United States Government, through our Agency for International Development (USAID), teamed up with the Ghana Health Service to develop and launch the \u201cGood Life, Live it Well\u201d campaign.<\/p>\n<p>Using both traditional and digital media, this campaign promotes positive health behaviors including on reproductive health, malaria prevention, and nutrition.\u00a0 After all, \u201can ounce of prevention Is worth a pound of cure.\u201d This campaign also encourages self-reflection about what makes life \u201cgood\u201d and links personal happiness and the \u201cgood life\u201d to healthy behaviors.<\/p>\n<p>Under the \u201cGood Life, Live it Well\u201d Campaign, USAID worked with the Ghana Health Service and the National Population Council, including providing financial support, to produce the YOLO series.<\/p>\n<p>This award-winning show has not only provided a platform to reach young people with key information on healthy behaviors and practices but it has also helped shape the actors to become \u201creproductive health ambassadors.\u201d\u00a0 The show\u2019s young stars serve as influential peer educators and role models, promoting healthy lifestyles to their many young social media followers.<\/p>\n<p>Youth participation and youth leadership are vital to development. They can contribute to more sustainable investments to end cycles of poverty; build resilient, democratic societies; improve health and nutrition outcomes; and strengthen economies. After all, the youth hold the future in their hands.\u00a0So it is very much in Ghana\u2019s national interest to set them up for success.<\/p>\n<p>That is why the United States has partnered with Ghana to support behavior change activities for more than 20 years, encouraging Ghanaians, especially young people, to make positive life changes, so that, even though \u201cYou Only Live Once,\u201d that life will be the best it can be. I\u2019d like to commend the Government of Ghana, especially the National Population Council, the Ghana Health Service, and their media partners, for their leadership in making adolescent health a priority.<\/p>\n<p>This is indeed a strategic approach, as today, more than 50% of Ghanaians are under age 25.\u00a0 Let me cite a piece of African wisdom I learned when I first served in Ghana some 20 years ago: \u201cWhen your parents look after you for your teeth to grow, then you look after them for their teeth to fall out.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In closing, I\u2019d like to assure you that the United States Government remains committed to working with all of you in partnership to improve the health and well-being of young people.\u00a0 Together, we will continue to encourage youth to make good choices and have a \u201cGood Life, Live it Well\u201d&#8230;it\u2019s an every day thing!<\/p>\n<p>Thank You.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Accra, Ghana \u2013 The United States Ambassador to Ghana, Stephanie S.
