Minister of Education, Dr. Yaw Osei Adutwum to mark the handing over of 3.7 million additional Basic 1 to Basic 3 English teaching and learning materials, including supplementary readers to the Ministry for Education.\u00a0 The materials will reach over 11,000 schools which have not already received the materials. The materials are designed to enable teachers to deliver engaging and effective reading lessons and improve pupils\u2019 ability to read.<\/p>\n<p>Ambassador Palmer said, \u201cThe U.S. Government is pleased to support the Ministry of Education and its agencies in providing 3.7 million books to over 11,000 schools across Ghana.\u00a0 We are delighted that these materials were developed here in Ghana by Ghanaian writers, illustrators, designers, and editors, making them both relevant and engaging for students. Printing these books in Ghana also created dozens of jobs and contributes to prosperity in the United States and Ghana.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Through the Partnership for Education program, the U.S. government has increased the availability of quality materials in schools to improve teaching and learning and provided more than 10 million learning materials to Ghana since 2014. The materials include Teacher Guides, Pupils Books, Supplementary Leveled Readers, and classroom materials including Alphabet Cards and Word Cards in English, all aligned to the new curriculum, for B1, B2 and B3 grade levels.\u00a0 The book donation represents a $5 million dollar investment, a part of the larger, nearly $100 million overall U.S. investment in education in Ghana over the past eight years.<\/p>\n<p>The collaboration between USAID and Ghana\u2019s Ministry of Education is one of the key partnerships between the United States and Ghana and supports the early grade reading of learners in Ghana. Since 2014, working together, the U.S. government and Government of Ghana have trained over 70,000 teachers, headteachers, and curriculum leads, and reached over 750,000 pupils.\u00a0 The latest donation will bring the number of schools supported from 7,200 to over 16,000 across Ghana.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">###<\/p>\n<p><strong>About USAID<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>USAID is the lead U.S. Government agency that works to end extreme global poverty and enable resilient, democratic societies to realize their potential.

We have long recognized the importance of literacy and ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education for all.<\/p>\n<p>Today highlights the important partnership between the U.S. Government and the Ministry of Education to provide quality education to primary students. Over the last eight years, the U.S. Government has remained focused and committed to supporting the Government of Ghana to improve early grade reading achievements in English and the official Ghanaian Languages.\u00a0 I became a convert of the Learning to Read concept because you can\u2019t read to learn until you learn to read.<\/p>\n<p>We support context-relevant, quality teaching and learning materials and have provided over 15 million of these materials to support the efforts of both teachers and learners.<\/p>\n<p>An external evaluation of <em>Learning<\/em>\u2019s early grade reading program in 2019 found that the program had the largest effect of any early grade reading program worldwide, with a tenfold increase in average words per minute in reading.<\/p>\n<p>Literacy, as we all know, holds the transformative key to economic progress of every country. And when children have access to books, they learn to read faster. We also know that when teachers effectively use these materials, early grade learners improve in reading achievement.\u00a0 The materials we are commissioning today include a range of Teacher Guides, Pupil Books, Pupil Workbooks, Read Aloud Compendium, Alphabet Cards, Word Cards, and Supplementary level Readers.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s particularly important that these materials were developed by Ghanaian writers, illustrators, designers, and editors, making them both relevant and engaging for Ghanaian learners. We\u2019re also delighted that the materials are being printed in Ghana, and that\u2019s created dozens of jobs for Ghanaians along the way.\u00a0 [Through efforts like these] I truly believe we can create prosperity in Ghana and the United States.<\/p>\n<p>I want to end with sincere thanks to Ghanaian educators.\u00a0 You are incredibly important to the nation and we don\u2019t thank you enough.\u00a0 You shape the future of this beautiful country.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Accra, GHANA \u2013 On August 30, 2022, U.S. Ambassador Virginia Palmer joined the Hon.
