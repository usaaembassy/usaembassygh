Piracy and illegal fishing in the Gulf of Guinea are a persistent menace, threatening the livelihoods and traditions of Ghana\u2019s fishing industry. \u00a0We\u2019ve all heard the stories of international trawlers operating just off the coast that threaten the livelihoods of tens of thousands of fishermen across the Gulf of Guinea. \u00a0And there are few regions that depend on fishing more than here in the Western Region.<\/p>\n<p>These vessels are the newest component of U.S. support to protect and regenerate these fragile fisheries. \u00a0We are providing $24 million over five years to help the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture install electronic monitoring systems on trawlers licensed to fish in Ghana and to assist the Ministry, working with the University of Cape Coast, to designate Marine Protected Areas that restrict fishing and other activities to protect fragile ecosystems and species found there. \u00a0These boats\u2019 patrols will ensure \u2013 and magnify \u2013 the effect of these efforts.<\/p>\n<p>Secure waters are key to Ghana\u2019s prosperity.\u00a0 These vessels will help deny pirates, traffickers, and other criminals the use of the sea for their illegal activities, making Ghana and the region not just safer but more prosperous. \u00a0Instances of piracy and armed robbery in the Gulf peaked at 123 in 2020 and have plummeted since with only 5 such instances through March of this year. Ghana\u2019s National Integrated Maritime Strategy is a continuation of that effort to make the Gulf safe for all.<\/p>\n<p>Secure maritime commercial routes mean more economic growth as well.\u00a0 Gulf of Guinea maritime routes will only become more important as the region continues its economic integration.\u00a0 As the African Continental Free Trade Agreement eliminates trade barriers, the region is poised to benefit \u2013 and safe, efficient transport will be a key enabler for that growth.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ll close by thanking the many Ghanaians and Americans who worked together to make this handover possible, by thanking you, Your Excellency, sincerely, for your regional and international leadership and for the partnership between the U.S. and Ghanaian militaries which makes us all more secure and more prosperous.\u00a0 Medase.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Vessels Will Improve Maritime Security in Ghana and the Gulf of Guinea Sekondi, W\/R, Ghana \u2013 U.S. Ambassador Virginia Palmer joined President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo and Government of Ghana and Ghana Navy officials in Sekondi this morning to commission two new security ships.\u00a0 The boundary class ships provided by the United States Government will &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1058,"featured_media":23663,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_gpalab_slo_mission_select":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[4,37,44,54,61],"tags":[6562,4066,5882],"class_list":["post-23660","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-ambassador","category-news","category-press-releases","category-speeches","category-us-and-gh","tag-ghana-us-security-collaboration","tag-press-release","tag-us-embassy-ghana"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) -
