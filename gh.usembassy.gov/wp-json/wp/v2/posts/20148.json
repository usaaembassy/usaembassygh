Participants co-designed a map of the Ghanaian seed system and created a strategy that integrated the needs and vision of the public and private sectors.<\/p>\n<p>During the workshop, participating teams will compete for funding to develop commercial seed technologies. Up to three participating teams will be awarded up to $12,000 each.\u00a0 BHEARD staff will work directly with the winners to identify opportunities to scale up the successful technologies.<\/p>\n<p>The BHEARD Program is a $4.9 million, USAID-funded, multi-year program as part of Feed the Future, the U.S. government\u2019s global hunger and food security initiative. BHEARD is a long-term agriculture degree (MSc and PhD) and food security training program in support of agriculture-led growth and poverty reduction. The program provides opportunities for selected public institutions to build their capacity in research, production, trade, policy, management, and outreach to promote greater agriculture-led economic growth and natural resources management.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>About USAID<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>USAID is the lead U.S. Government agency that works to end extreme global poverty and enable resilient, democratic societies to realize their potential.
