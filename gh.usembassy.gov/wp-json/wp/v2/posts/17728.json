The goal of the report is to stimulate action and create partnerships around the world in the fight against modern slavery.<\/p>\n<p>Ghana is ranked as a Tier 2 Watch List country in the U.S. Department of State\u2019s 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report.<\/p>\n<p>In calendar year 2016, the Government of Ghana did not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking, but made significant efforts to do so. The Trafficking Victims Protection Act provides for a waiver to remain on the Tier 2 Watch List for a third consecutive year if the government develops a national plan of action to combat human trafficking and dedicates sufficient resources for its implementation that, when implemented, would constitute significant efforts to meet the minimum standards.<\/p>\n<p>Because the Government of Ghana devoted sufficient resources to a written plan of action that, if implemented, would constitute significant efforts to meet the minimum standards, Ghana was granted a waiver from an otherwise required downgrade to Tier 3. Ghana could be subject to an automatic downgrade to Tier 3 in the 2018 TIP Report. If Ghana is downgraded to Tier 3, it will become subject to restrictions on U.S. assistance.<\/p>\n<p>The TIP report\u2019s recommendations for Ghana comprise nine goals and objectives, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increasing the number of traffickers held accountable for their crimes by providing sufficient support for the police, immigration service and attorney general\u2019s office to investigate and prosecute trafficking offenses;<\/li>\n<li>Increasing government support for comprehensive trauma-informed care and reintegration services for children in government-operated shelters, including child sex trafficking victims; and<\/li>\n<li>Implementing the national plan of action against trafficking with dedicated resources, including funding and implementation of the human trafficking fund.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Commenting on the report, U.S. Ambassador to Ghana Robert Jackson said,<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Government of Ghana has taken initial steps this year to protect Ghanaian men, women and children from being enslaved. We urge the government to remain vigilant and to fully implement the new national plan of action against trafficking. When funded as promised, Ghana will be better able to prevent and prosecute trafficking and provide support services for victims of trafficking in Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe theme of this year\u2019s report says it all: traffickers must be held criminally accountable. Unless Ghanaians work with law enforcement and the courts to bring traffickers to justice, they will continue to commit these horrific crimes. This isn\u2019t about what the United States wants Ghana to do. It\u2019s about Ghanaian men, women and children who are suffering because traffickers are allowed to violate Ghana\u2019s laws and morality.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. government is funding several programs in Ghana to address trafficking and child labor. In June 2015, President Mahama and then-Ambassador Gene Cretz signed the Child Protection Compact (CPC) Partnership. The CPC Partnership is a jointly developed, multi-year plan aimed at bolstering current efforts of the government of Ghana and Ghanaian civil society to address child sex trafficking and forced child labor within Ghana. The Partnership awarded $5 million in U.S. foreign assistance to the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and NGO Free the Slaves to combat forced child labor and child sex trafficking in the Volta, Central, and Greater Accra regions.<\/p>\n<p>Most recently, the CPC Partnership funded training for judges on adjudicating trafficking in persons cases.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Mobilizing Community Action and Promoting Opportunities for Youth in Ghana\u2019s Cocoa-Growing Communities (MOCA) project is providing $4.5 million to empower 40 cocoa-growing communities in the Ashanti and Western Regions to design and implement Community Action Plans (CAPs) to address child labor at the community level. Additional USDOL projects include $1.5 million to assess the prevalence of child labor in the cocoa sectors of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Ghana; $3 million to assess the effectiveness of interventions in these sectors; and $5 million to develop and implement strategies to reduce child labor and improve working conditions in artisanal and small-scale gold mining.<\/p>\n<p>USAID Ghana\u2019s Sustainable Fisheries Management Project, a $24 million project aimed at rebuilding marine fisheries stocks and catches through adoption of responsible fishing practices, also includes deliberate steps towards reducing child labor and trafficking in the Central Region of Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMore than 100,000 men, women, and children in Ghana are suffering in modern-day slavery,\u201d added Ambassador Jackson. \u201cThese victims have hopes and dreams and they deserve better than to be enslaved in brothels or sold into slavery on Lake Volta for as little as the price of a bottle of schnapps. Human trafficking is a $150 billion industry and every country \u2014 including Ghana and including the United States \u2014 must do everything possible to stop this human trade.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ghana\u2019s TIP report can be viewed at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.state.gov\/j\/tip\/rls\/tiprpt\/countries\/2017\/271194.htm\">https:\/\/www.state.gov\/j\/tip\/rls\/tiprpt\/countries\/2017\/271194.htm<\/a>.

The Report also contains narratives that describe the scope of human trafficking in each country, anti-trafficking efforts of each government, and discussions of important issues related to human trafficking.
