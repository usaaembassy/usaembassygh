The United States government is a solid partner with you in fighting this scourge.<\/p>\n<p>Every year the United States Government sends a report to Congress on efforts to combat trafficking in persons in countries around the world. The Government of Ghana increased its efforts over the past year and therefore retained its Tier 2 ranking.<\/p>\n<p>These efforts included increasing resources dedicated to implementation of its anti-trafficking action plan; sentencing more convicted traffickers to significant prison terms; improving inter-ministerial, interagency, \u00a0and civil society cooperation to identify and remove children from trafficking situations; increasing anti-trafficking public awareness activities; and adopting systematic trafficking data collection procedures. Ayikoo!<\/p>\n<p>As his Excellency President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo stated one year ago, at the launch of PANAFEST during the year of return, \u201cnever again should African people go through such inhumane treatment.\u201d As the chairman has pointed out, no country is immune from modern day trafficking. But we\u2019re here today to end human trafficking here in Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019d like to see Ghana strengthen its efforts further, by devoting additional resources and building further capacity, increasing shelter space for victims, and amending the anti-trafficking act regulations to remove the option of a fine in lieu of imprisonment in cases where the trafficker is a parent or guardian of the child victim. Fines can be viewed as the \u201ccost of doing business.\u201d But consistent enforcement of consequences &#8211; of serving time in prison &#8211; will be a stronger deterrent.<\/p>\n<p>You, the media, have a role to play. You can help citizens be alert to the signs of a trafficked person, and can help people &#8211; families and potential victims alike &#8211; be wary of offers that seem too good to be true, both within Ghana and abroad, offers of employment or education opportunities that are really wolves in sheep\u2019s clothing. You can cover the court cases and follow up to report on convictions to amplify the deterrent effect.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s help people fulfill their potential and not be held back by the scourge of human trafficking. The United States stands ready to continue supporting Ghana\u2019s efforts to eradicate human trafficking.\u00a0 Thank you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Remarks by U.S. Ambassador Stephanie S.
