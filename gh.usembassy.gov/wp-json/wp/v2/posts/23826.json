Ghanaian app creators, fintechs, database programmers, and website designers are landing contracts to provide those services in the United States.\u00a0 And the same is true in the other direction, as well.\u00a0 We bring expertise in cyber, blockchain, and cloud computing, for example. These activities are creating employment in both of our of countries.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_23830\" aria-labelledby=\"figcaption_attachment_23830\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 760px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-large wp-image-23830\" title=\"Ambassador Palmer at Tech in Ghana\" src=\"https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/Amb-Palmer_Tech-in-Ghana-1-750x446.jpg\" alt=\"Ambassador Palmer at Tech in Ghana\" width=\"750\" height=\"446\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/Amb-Palmer_Tech-in-Ghana-1-750x446.jpg 750w, https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/Amb-Palmer_Tech-in-Ghana-1-350x208.jpg 350w, https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/Amb-Palmer_Tech-in-Ghana-1-768x456.jpg 768w, https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/Amb-Palmer_Tech-in-Ghana-1-1536x912.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/Amb-Palmer_Tech-in-Ghana-1-2048x1217.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/Amb-Palmer_Tech-in-Ghana-1-175x105.jpg 175w, https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/Amb-Palmer_Tech-in-Ghana-1-200x119.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" \/><figcaption id=\"figcaption_attachment_23830\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ambassador Palmer at Tech in Ghana<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Digital Transformation with Africa<br \/>\n<\/strong><span style=\"font-family: arial;font-size: 14px\">At the Africa Leaders Summit in Washington last December, the U.S. Government announced the Digital Transformation with Africa or DTA initiative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>DTA seeks to expand digital access, literacy, and infrastructure across the African continent. It marshals U.S. government resources and private capital to work in three key areas: digital economy and infrastructure; human capital development; and the digital enabling environment.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to various areas of support we have in Ghana and across Africa to support digital connectivity, this week we have a strong U.S. government team from Washington in Accra from our State and Commerce Departments and USAID. This team is here to support the goals of DTA and the important discussions Ghana is leading at the Global Conference on Cyber Capacity Building.<\/p>\n<p>Further, our Embassy brought 10 U.S. partners to Tech In Ghana \u2013 from leading companies in cybersecurity and blockchain, to universities, training and certification partners, to experts in financing and international partnerships.\u00a0 They want to meet with all of you and to explore areas of collaboration.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Infrastructure<br \/>\n<\/strong>Across Africa, there is a call for investment in infrastructure.\u00a0 This includes digital infrastructure, where the needs are great.<\/p>\n<p>Last month, our Development Finance Corporation announced a major investment in a data center here in Ghana. Additionally, our U.S. Trade and Development Agency, \u201cUSTDA,\u201d recently reopened an office in Accra. USTDA is providing feasibility studies that help to mobilize additional capital to fund key ICT infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>Yet we cannot take for granted the progress Ghana has made, in part thanks to large, early investments by companies such as American Towers Corporation.<\/p>\n<p>That infrastructure created the backbone for Ghana\u2019s current digital economy.\u00a0 Those existing investors are still here, and in some cases are owed significant arrears for services already rendered.\u00a0 Potential future investors \u2013 in any country and any business sector \u2013 always observe the treatment of previous or current investors in making their own determinations about what opportunities to pursue.\u00a0 Thus the timely completion of outstanding arrears payments will help ensure that Ghana continues to attract the next waves of investment and reinvestment.<\/p>\n<p>As a side note, I would note that reinvestment means more than just new infrastructure.\u00a0 It also means investment in projects that give back to the communities in which those companies operate.\u00a0 Just last week, I helped American Tower Commission its 19<sup>th<\/sup> Digital Community center across Ghana to provide training and support digital literacy among Ghana\u2019s youth population.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Education and Training<br \/>\n<\/strong>The critical role of education, training, and upskilling comes to my attention time and time again.<\/p>\n<p>We saw a huge milestone a few weeks ago \u2013 the number of students from Ghana attending U.S. colleges and universities grew by over 30 percent this past year, one of the highest increases of any country in the world.\u00a0 STEM and engineering continue to be major areas of study.<\/p>\n<p>And within Ghana itself, BASICs International is working to train students on Amazon Web Services and Cisco systems. \u00a0<em>Lab Four <\/em>is developing curriculum to provide ICT and cybersecurity certifications.\u00a0 Northeastern University is partnering with the University of Ghana and Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in Kumasi to offer joint degrees.\u00a0 These are just a few examples.<\/p>\n<p>These educational experiences give rise to a lifetime of personal and business collaboration between our countries and companies.\u00a0 Many of you have this lived experience and straddle several international business worlds yourself.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ghana\u2019s Innovation and International Partners<br \/>\n<\/strong>What is particularly encouraging to me is the international recognition and support that homegrown Ghanaian national champions are getting from U.S. and international foundations and private sector partners.<\/p>\n<p>For example, in July, Ghana\u2019s <em>minoHealth AI Labs<\/em> received a Global Grand Challenges grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\u00a0 <em>minoHealth AI<\/em> will use the grant to continue its pathbreaking work on using AI for medical diagnostics, with the goal to bring better and less expensive healthcare to more Africans.<\/p>\n<p>Ghana is leading the rest of us forward.\u00a0 Our collaborations are supporting African solutions to African challenges and opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>In Ghana, there is often so much great activity \u201chiding in plain sight.\u201d \u00a0Therefore, it is particularly gratifying to come to this event, where that activity is no longer hiding, but is showcased for further development.<\/p>\n<p>I wish you great success over the next two days as you delve into panels of experts to explore emerging tech issues in Ghana and meet to form partnerships that solidify Ghana\u2019s role in the global digital community.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Remarks by Ambassador Virginia Palmer at Tech In Ghana November 28, 2023 -As prepared- Thank you.\u00a0 It is my pleasure to visit Tech In Ghana for the first time.\u00a0 This is the see and be seen event for Ghana\u2019s ICT ecosystem! \u00a0Congratulations to the Tech in Ghana team and to our friends at the British &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1058,"featured_media":23831,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_gpalab_slo_mission_select":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[4,54],"tags":[10026,7434],"class_list":["post-23826","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-ambassador","category-speeches","tag-ambassador-palmer","tag-amcham"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) -
