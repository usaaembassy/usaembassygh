While cybercrime threats\u00a0can\u00a0come from anywhere \u2013 from lone individuals to nation states \u2013 the greatest challenges arise\u00a0from\u00a0emerging transnational networks\u00a0that\u00a0allow\u00a0once-isolated criminals to join forces with one another, often anonymously.<\/p>\n<p>Transnational organized criminals\u00a0are\u00a0constantly finding new ways to use technology\u00a0to facilitate traditional crimes,\u00a0for example\u00a0using\u00a0crypto\u00a0currencies and the Dark Web\u00a0to\u00a0create illicit\u00a0global\u00a0markets for drugs, weapons, illicit wildlife products, and human trafficking.<\/p>\n<p>Fast-evolving cybercrime techniques pose a tremendous challenge to law enforcement, especially where real time engagement is required among developing nations with limited resources.\u00a0 As we saw back in February, thanks to coordination between U.S. and Ghanaian law enforcement, the FBI arrested six criminals in Ghana for more than $50 million in cyber crimes including money laundering, online scams, fraud, and identify theft. \u00a0It was through international cooperation between the\u00a0 United States and Ghana that these criminals were brought to justice.<\/p>\n<p>Ransomware targeting private industry is a growing threat to the global economy, including Ghana and the United States.\u00a0 As more businesses moved online during the last year and a half, so did criminals. \u00a0We must remind ourselves that criminals and their online techniques have no borders, and they have no morals. \u00a0Without robust cybersecurity, cyber criminals also have no limits to the effects they can have on Ghana\u2019s economy as they target businesses, government, and individuals.<\/p>\n<p>For President Biden, cyber security is a top priority and essential to national and economic security.\u00a0 We know our allies and partners are a tremendous source of strength and advantage in the continuing fight against cyber criminals.\u00a0 We look forward to our continuing and collaborative relationship between the United States and Ghana,<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Protection of Critical Information Infrastructure Directive Remarks for Charge Nicole Chulick National Communications Authority Tower Conference Room October 1, 2021 -As Delivered- &nbsp; Joe Anokye, Director-General, National Communications Authority Albert Antwi-Boasiako, National Security Advisor Maxwell Opoku-Afari, First Deputy Governor, Bank of Ghana Honorable Matthew Opoku Prempeh, Minister for Energy Honorable Ursula Owusu-Ekuful, Minister for Communications &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1058,"featured_media":21951,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_gpalab_slo_mission_select":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[15],"tags":[4320,10000],"class_list":["post-21949","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-deputy-chief-of-mission","tag-cybersecurity","tag-nicole-chulick"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) -
