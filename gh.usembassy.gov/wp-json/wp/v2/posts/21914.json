For more details on this and other opportunities, please see the U.S. Embassy website or social media pages.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Muqthar was selected for his proven leadership and positive contributions to his community, and we\u2019re so pleased to see how he\u2019s continued to shine.\u00a0 Thank you, Mutaru, for your dedicated work through WACCE to empower youth and inspire leadership in peace, human rights, and good governance in Ghana. I\u2019d also like to thank all of the distinguished speakers and participants present, as well as those who are watching on GBC. I also join in my thanks to the Chair for the minute of silence. I appreciate the incisive remarks made by today\u2019s speakers so far.<\/p>\n<p>Tomorrow, we mark the 20th anniversary of the 9\/11 attacks, and mourn the nearly 3,000 lives taken too soon. \u00a0More than 90 countries lost citizens in the attacks, including Ghana, which lost two Ghanaians and two Ghanaian Americans. \u00a0The people who perished in the Twin Towers, the Pentagon, and the field in Shanksville, PA \u2013 including the heroic first responders who rushed to trouble and gave their lives to help others \u2013 left behind loved ones and communities who were never the same. \u00a0We honor their lives and their memory on this solemn occasion and mourn what we all lost on that terrible day.<\/p>\n<p>I had just returned to the United States the month before, from my previous assignment in Ghana, and had started my new job at the Department of State only days before.\u00a0 In the midst of the surreal silence of the skies, when all air traffic suspended for several days, what really heartened us as Americans was the global outpouring of goodwill and solidarity.<\/p>\n<p>Today we gather in that same spirit of solidarity and collaboration to address a common threat to our shared peace and stability.\u00a0 Violent extremism threatens our democratic institutions, our collective security, and our economic prosperity.\u00a0 Together, we must <u>prevent<\/u> this global scourge and <u>counter<\/u> violent extremism where it has already taken root. \u00a0Building on the lessons of the last 20 years, we know we need to employ a sustainable and agile approach that includes sharing intelligence, building global partnerships, and most importantly, investing in inclusive development &#8211; and that means inclusive of the youth as well &#8211;\u00a0 accountable governance, preventive diplomacy, and professionalism in the security services in ways that make it harder for terrorists to recruit and operate with impunity.<\/p>\n<p>Ghana is a regional leader in peace and security, especially through its contributions to international peacekeeping missions and as current chair of ECOWAS. But as the earlier speaker noted, Ghana can\u2019t take peace for granted, and I\u2019d like to add that Ghana shouldn\u2019t export all its peace!<\/p>\n<p>The United States is deeply committed to collaborating with Ghana to maintain peace and security.\u00a0 We recognize that a multifaceted approach is fundamental to prevent and counter violent extremism. To that end, we are partnering with Ghanaians in a number of areas ranging from: working with the public sector and civil society organizations, supporting vulnerable communities, to engaging in traditional military-to-military activities.<\/p>\n<p>Ghana\u2019s National Framework for Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism and Terrorism in Ghana guides our programs, which are aligned with Ghana\u2019s strategy to <strong>Prevent, Preempt, Protect<\/strong>, and if necessary, <strong>Respond<\/strong>, and with Ghana\u2019s new National Security Strategy.<\/p>\n<p>The most important programs are those that support Ghana\u2019s efforts to <strong>prevent<\/strong> violent extremism from taking hold.\u00a0 Through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), we are helping to reduce extremists\u2019 ability to radicalize, recruit, mobilize, and inspire violent acts.\u00a0 USAID supports the development of early warning indicators from communities, engagements with regional security councils, public education on non-violence, and other activities aimed at Preventing Violent Extremism. As my grandmother often said, \u201cAn ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>We also have a number of projects aimed at enhancing the value chain to improve economic opportunities, such as supporting the Global Shea Alliance and Mobilizing Finance for Agriculture, to name just two.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to <strong>preempting<\/strong> violent extremism in Ghana, the United States is working closely with the Ghana Armed Forces (GAF) to identify risks and uncover threats.\u00a0 Our programs are designed to help enhance a sustainable capability within the GAF to process, analyze, and disseminate intelligence to decisionmakers so that they can rapidly respond to emerging threats.<\/p>\n<p>We believe the best results can be achieved when civilian and military institutions work together to prevent and counter violent extremism.\u00a0 At Ghana\u2019s request, the United States has dedicated a Civil Military Support Element to work alongside Ghana Armed Forces leaders in that effort.\u00a0 Here, let me stress that the professionalism of the security services is of vital importance. The 2017 UNDP report called \u201cJourney to Extremism in Africa\u201d found that 71 percent of those recruited and radicalized in Sub-Saharan Africa had become that way after they, or someone close to them, had had a serious negative interaction with government security personnel.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of <strong>protection<\/strong>, the United States is working closely with the Government of Ghana to assist security services with protecting vulnerable areas and populations.\u00a0 Paramount among these activities is our partnership with Ghana through the Security Governance Initiative or SGI, which I co-chair with my fellow panelist National Security Coordinator Major General Adu-Amanfoh.\u00a0 SGI focuses on supporting Ghana\u2019s interministerial efforts to improve the management, accountability, and sustainability of security sector institutions and strengthen border security to prevent violent extremism from spilling over Ghana\u2019s borders. SGI also has a maritime security, cybersecurity, and underlying administration of justice focus.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, as a last resort, it is important that Ghana be prepared to <strong>respond<\/strong> to violent extremist or terrorist attacks.\u00a0 To that end, the United States is partnering with Ghana to provide training on crisis response and counterterrorism operations.\u00a0Ghana has been invited to participate in Exercise Flintlock in 2022 and to host the exercise in 2023.\u00a0 Exercise Flintlock is a U.S.-led exercise that includes participants from more than 30 African countries and partner nations to strengthen their ability to cooperatively counter violent extremist organizations, protect their borders, and support regional stability.<\/p>\n<p>None of our work would be possible without collaboration from committed partners and stakeholders like all of you joining this forum.\u00a0 Today\u2019s event is a significant step in our collective efforts to address root causes and find solutions to preventing extremism. \u00a0I look forward to the insights from the panel and the discussion.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for your kind attention and for this 20<sup>th<\/sup> anniversary commemoration of the horrific attacks of 9\/11 that changed the world for all of us.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ambassador\u2019s Remarks at the National Security Dialogue West Africa Center for Counter Extremism Ghana Broadcasting Corporation Friday, September 10, 10:50 a.m. Good morning!
