The activity will also offer affordable financing options for select low-cost private schools serving disadvantaged communities in northern Ghana. The activity is committed to serving populations in the most under-resourced locations in the northern section of the country.\u00a0 The activity will also strengthen the relationship and regulator capacity of the Ministry of Education and certain Ministry of Education agencies in its oversight of private schools.<\/p>\n<p>By the end of five years, USAID anticipates that the project will strengthen business skills for more than 200 school leaders, equip 400 teacher mentors with evidence-based classroom best practices to teach another 2,000 teachers, and certify 1,200 untrained teachers. USAID implementing partner Opportunity International will also create a School Capacity Building Fund (SCBF) to assist the targeted schools to improve operations and become more credit-worthy through catalytic grants.<\/p>\n<p>###<\/p>\n<p><strong>About USAID<\/strong><br \/>\nThe United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is the lead U.S. Government agency that works to end extreme global poverty and enable resilient, democratic societies to realize their potential.
