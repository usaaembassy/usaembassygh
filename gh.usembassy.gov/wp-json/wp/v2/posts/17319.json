During the trip, Mr. Karas met with a number of USAID partners and reiterated the U.S. government\u2019s support for promoting opportunity and development in the Volta Region by investing in its people.<\/p>\n<p>During the trip, Mr. Karas visited kindergartens in Battor and Fodzoku. USAID supported the construction of these two kindergartens, which opened last year and have increased school enrollment in the region. At the schools, Mr. Karas discussed issues such as an increased student population, education for children with special needs, teacher absenteeism, and strengthening the reading comprehension of children in early grades with the headmasters and teachers. In addition, he visited the Regional Education Office in Ho, where he met with civil servants and staff who are responsible for the management of education institutions, finances, and resources.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUSAID recognizes the importance of boosting the quality of education in kindergarten and primary schools,\u201d said Mr. Karas. \u201cWe are truly committed to working with the Government of Ghana to ensure every Ghanaian child has the chance to reach his or her potential.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Karas also visited a number of USAID health sites and met with USAID partners working on health issues in the Volta Region. He visited USAID-supported community health nurses training colleges in Ho and Hohoe; the Regional Health Office, where he spoke with regional health officials on how to improve health outcomes; a small town water scheme in Abutia Teti, where USAID works to increase access to improved water and sanitation; and a Community-Based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) Compound in Akome, where he met with student nurses conducting practical training. The CHPS Compound provides basic preventative and curative health care services in maternal and reproductive health, health education, and neonatal and child health directly to communities. In addition, Mr. Karas toured a USAID-funded isolation unit at the Volta Regional Hospital where students are trained to prevent the spread of infectious diseases like the Ebola Virus and other pandemic illnesses.<\/p>\n<p>While in the Volta Region, Mr. Karas participated in a program, along with traditional leaders, district health officials, and community members, which was organized by Radio Dayi, a community radio station in Anfoega. At the event, Mr. Karas commended the radio station for its work to mobilize communities to improve their health. \u201cUSAID partners with 10 community radio stations, including Radio Dayi. We train volunteers at these stations to produce compelling programs that teach their communities about health,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s feeding a newborn properly or sleeping under an insecticide-treated net, even small actions by communities can have big results.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>###<\/p>\n<p><em>About USAID<br \/>\n<\/em>USAID is the lead U.S. government agency that works to end extreme global poverty and enable resilient, democratic societies to realize their potential.
