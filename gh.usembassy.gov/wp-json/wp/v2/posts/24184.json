This funding will support AMAATI, a Ghanaian social enterprise, to expand its fonio processing capacity from three to ten metric tonnes per day at its factory in Tamale.<\/p>\n<p>Fonio is a drought-resistant, gluten-free, grain from the millet family. It regenerates degraded soil and is packed with numerous nutrients and health benefits.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFonio isn\u2019t just a grain; it\u2019s a symbol of resilience, empowerment, and progress, for communities across northern Ghana, especially for women who have limited access to land,\u201d said USAID\/Ghana Deputy Mission Director Grace Lang during the opening of the expanded AMAATI fonio factory in Tamale.<\/p>\n<p>Since 2021, USAID\u2019s West Africa Trade and Investment Hub (WATIH) has supported AMAATI, which pioneered the revival of fonio in northern Ghana, to develop a 1,000-hectare fonio farm, train 8,100 landless and disenfranchised farmers, mainly women and youth, to produce and process fonio, to engage in good agricultural practices, and to export fonio worth $4.6 million (66.9 million Ghana Cedis).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis factory represents our [USAID and AMAATI] joint commitment to develop the fonio market in West Africa. It will enable more women and youth in northern Ghana to engage in fonio farming and facilitate value-added manufacturing of the super grain for domestic consumption and export\u201d Lang added.<br \/>\nThe United States is Ghana\u2019s largest bilateral development partner. In 2023 USAID\u2019s bilateral development assistance, totaling over $140 million, was dedicated to supporting agriculture, economic growth, health, education, governance, and more.<\/p>\n<p>WATIH supports businesses, like AMAATI, to increase productivity and competitiveness, and access the U.S. market. Through the African Growth and Opportunities Act (AGOA), Ghana can export more than 6,500 products to the United States duty free.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">####<\/p>\n<p><strong>About USAID<\/strong><br \/>\nUSAID is the lead U.S. government agency that works to end extreme global poverty and enable resilient, democratic societies to realize their potential.
