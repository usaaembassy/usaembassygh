We have also worked with district assemblies to monitor the implementation of these projects and prevent waste or fraud. \u00a0These efforts paid off: the majority of the projects we monitored \u2014 including clinics, sanitation facilities, and schools \u2014 are on schedule or were completed on time. \u00a0Dedicated and tenacious district officials and community members mobilized to stop corruption.\u00a0 As a result, more Ghanaians now receive quality healthcare and education.<\/p>\n<p>Activities like this have made a real difference, but there is much more to be done. Corruption is a pervasive problem throughout the world \u2014 yes, even in my own country. \u00a0In the United States, government leaders are sentenced to prison for accepting bribes, embezzling public monies, and abusing their power. \u00a0A 2015 Gallup Survey revealed that three out of every four American citizens perceived corruption as widespread in our government \u2014 up from two out of three Americans in 2009.\u00a0 While we certainly have some serious issues to address back home, most Americans continue to express confidence in how we as a nation are working to combat this corruption, with the help of a robust civil society, a press that is free to speak out, and a government that enforces a fair and transparent rule of law.<\/p>\n<p>What does the Ghanaian public think? \u00a0This past October, USAID partnered with the Ghana Integrity Initiative to conduct a survey.\u00a0 Nearly two-thirds of Ghanaian citizens said they believed corruption in their districts had increased over the past 12 months. \u00a0I often hear stories of struggling families having to pay bribes when working with customs officials, getting\u00a0 a driver\u2019s license, or obtaining a passport.\u00a0 Regional monitors report that a typical agricultural exporter in Ghana faces more than 40 checkpoints between Accra and the border with Burkina Faso \u2014 checkpoints that add up to more than $100 in so-called \u201cfacilitation payments.\u201d\u00a0 And we are still waiting for justice in the 2015 Tema Central Medical Stores arson case, which destroyed more than $80 million of medical supplies and drugs, including an estimated $7 million in donations from the American people. \u00a0This fire, which was ignited to cover up corruption, has dealt a significant blow to public health in Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>But now the time is ripe to step up efforts to counter this cancer. \u00a0Both the United States and Ghana swore in new presidents this month.\u00a0 It\u2019s a time of new beginnings and recommitting ourselves to policies that improve lives.<\/p>\n<p>I am heartened by President Nana Akufo-Addo\u2019s fervor for combatting corruption. During his inaugural address, he said,<br \/>\n\u201cWe must restore integrity in public life.\u00a0 State coffers are not spoils for the party that wins an election, but resources for the country&#8217;s social and economic development. \u00a0I shall protect the public purse, by insisting on value for money in all transactions.\u201d<br \/>\nEnd quote.\u00a0 Let me assure you, we want to work with you to realize President Akufo-Addo\u2019s vision.<\/p>\n<p>Now there is no \u201cone size fits all\u201d solution to tackle corruption.\u00a0 The United States certainly doesn\u2019t have any magic answers.\u00a0 But we are committed to partnering and engaging with all members of society \u2014 from the CEO of an apparel manufacturer to the Member of Parliament to the police officer managing the night security checkpoint.<\/p>\n<p>At the press event to launch this initiative, a member of the media asked, \u201cAre you going to tackle corruption from the top down or from the bottom up?\u201d\u00a0 The answer was, and is, and must be: Both.<\/p>\n<p>It is going to take ALL of us working together to make a dent in corruption.\u00a0 The fight against corruption must rise up from the grassroots, with citizen buy-in and a rejection of petty, daily bribery.\u00a0 It must trickle down from the top, with impeccable leadership ethics and sanctions against those who act otherwise.<\/p>\n<p>Think what we can do, if everyone in society is focused on the same fundamental principles: transparency, rule of law, stable institutions, and courts that efficiently enforce democratic laws.\u00a0 How could corruption survive if <em>all of us<\/em> were to be unceasingly vigilant against it?\u00a0 Who would be foolish enough to rob the people, knowing that police, prosecutors and judges are committed to implementing the law effectively, aggressively and impartially \u2014 enforcing the principle that no one is above the law.<\/p>\n<p>I see today\u2019s discussion today as the starting point for plotting our next steps and developing action items we can pursue together.\u00a0 To jumpstart the discussion, I will offer some specific suggestions for three key sets actors \u2014 all represented in this conference today. \u00a0These actors are the public sector, the private sector, and the broader public.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Recommendations for the Public Sector<\/strong><br \/>\nOn the public sector level, there is no substitute for political will. \u00a0The best way to demonstrate political <em>will<\/em> is by political example. \u00a0Zero incidence of corruption presumes zero tolerance of corruption \u2014 at all levels of government.\u00a0 Ghana\u2019s 1992 Constitution asserts that \u201cthe State shall take steps to eradicate corrupt practices and the abuse of power.\u201d\u00a0 That seems pretty clear to me.\u00a0 The Constitution itself provides the impetus for a concerted effort to fight and eradicate corruption.<\/p>\n<p>Ghana has successfully enacted laws and regulations to improve public financial management, such as the National Anti-Corruption Action Plan.\u00a0 Unfortunately, implementation is still weak. \u00a0We would welcome details from the new government on its priorities and specific areas in which the United States and other partner countries can provide support for the effective implementation of this plan.<\/p>\n<p>We also support reforms to create a well-informed populace. \u00a0The Right to Information Bill should be passed <em>immediately<\/em>. \u00a0And not only should Ghana continue to conduct audits of public spending, but it should ensure recommendations from these audits are implemented and taken seriously. \u00a0In addition, steps should be taken to increase transparency in public procurements, so Ghanaians get the best value, highest-quality services.<\/p>\n<p>In Chile, for example, a publicly accessible government procurement \u200ewebsite provides transparency in government contracting by allowing citizens to view opportunities to bid on government contracts, names of bidders, and the timeline of the bid.\u00a0 Citizens are also able to make anonymous formal complaints through this website.\u00a0 The system has been replicated in Guatemala, Brazil, and Ecuador.\u00a0 Why not Ghana?<\/p>\n<p>An independent judiciary is another critical element of this fight.\u00a0 The justice sector must have the resources, capacity, and will to prosecute cases of corruption and end impunity.\u00a0 We will support the government of Ghana in enhancing justice sector coordination and providing the necessary tools and training to strengthen the administration of justice.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Recommendations for the Private Sector<\/strong><br \/>\nHowever, we cannot let government shoulder all the responsibility.\u00a0 The private sector also plays a significant role in the fight against corruption. \u00a0Senior management is responsible for setting the tone and the highest standards of corporate ethics.\u00a0 Private organizations should have strong anti-fraud programs in place.<\/p>\n<p>For our part, the U.S. government will continue to work directly with Ghanaian businesses to ensure they meet international standards, and with Customs to eliminate avenues for corruption in international trade.\u00a0 Alongside the American Chamber of Commerce in Ghana, we promote transparency in the public tender process.\u00a0 We will always advocate for the American private sector to adhere to our <em>own<\/em> Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which governs American companies and promotes transparency. \u00a0These steps are critical to facilitating increased investment and economic growth in Ghana.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Recommendations for Citizens<\/strong><br \/>\nBut for any of these actions to be lasting, we need societal transformation. \u00a0We need the public to say, \u201cWe\u2019re tired of continuing with the way things are.\u00a0 Tired of navigating through corruption.\u00a0 Tired of paying bribes to obtain services that we should receive from our tax dollars.\u201d \u00a0Civil society organizations, the media, religious leaders, and community groups contribute to building a culture that refuses to tolerate corruption.<\/p>\n<p>We are committed to further strengthening the capacity of citizens and local organizations to denounce corruption, and advocate for lasting change.\u00a0 But we cannot want it more than those who will ultimately benefit. \u00a0Citizens must be prepared to hold themselves and their leaders to a higher standard.<\/p>\n<p>I often tell my staff at the U.S. Embassy that we are in the \u201clife improvement\u201d business.\u00a0 We care about better health, better education, better incomes, infrastructure, and security.\u00a0 We care about these things because a stable, democratic, and prosperous Ghana is good for Ghanaians and good for Americans.\u00a0 The foundation for that success lies in transparency and accountability.\u00a0 Living wages depend upon economic growth, and corruption undermines that growth.\u00a0 Instead of looking at every job to see how one can take advantage of it, how would it be if we asked how can the society benefit from it \u2013 with each of us being part of the society and thus a beneficiary.<\/p>\n<p>May today serve as the genesis of a sweeping anti-corruption effort that will improve lives and create opportunities for Ghana, the United States and like-minded partners everywhere.<\/p>\n<p>Thank You!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; Your Excellency Vice President Bawumia, Your Eminence Archbishop Duncan-Williams, Dear Colleagues,
