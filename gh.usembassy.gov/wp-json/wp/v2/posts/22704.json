The Shea Business Empowerment Program will connect local suppliers with global markets, track the sustainable sourcing of shea and soya from Ghana\u2019s North, and help local shea collectors transform their businesses into well-organized businesses that can actively and equitably participate in the global supply chain.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d really like to cheer again, the formidable woman, the driving force behind this partnership: Chief Executive Officer Dora Torwiseh.\u00a0 Dora, you\u2019re an example for us all and your leadership and what you\u2019re doing for women and girls in Ghana and beyond is really remarkable. \u00a0As you say, demonstrating that women can lead in business is an important game changer and model for women across Africa and beyond.\u00a0 Your work and commitment to improving the lives of women, who are the backbone of the shea industry in Ghana, and to promoting long-term trade partnership with an American company has made today possible.<\/p>\n<p>And, Lily from USAID was just telling me that Nuts For Growth has become a bunge special provider, which is quite a remarkable achievement. Congratulations!<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d also like to extend my thanks to the Ministry of Agriculture which has done remarkable and important things to continue to support the shea industry in Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>Congratulations, especially to the Mastercard Foundation and the Global Shea Alliance for their engagement with Nuts For Growth in promoting sustainable livelihoods for women, job creation, and preserving shea trees. \u00a0I was saying to Rosie that I\u2019ve already \u2013 I\u2019ve only been in Ghana really six weeks \u2013 and I\u2019ve seen remarkable things that the Mastercard Foundation is doing here already and it\u2019s great to see this one today.<\/p>\n<p>Through USAID\u2019s West Africa Trade &amp; Investment Hub \u2013 and Charles is here representing the Trade Hub \u2013 the United States is supporting Nuts For Growth and with its upcoming factory launch that will create 300 jobs in Tamale and help an additional 20,000 women through improvements in shea and soya production.<\/p>\n<p>By leveraging each other\u2019s investments, the Mastercard Foundation and the U.S. government amplify our impact on poverty reduction, youth employment, food security, and forest conservation in northern Ghana.\u00a0 The Mastercard Foundation is bringing a digital tool that improves the traceability of shea and soya; and the U.S. government increases the volume of shea and soya production; and together, we\u2019re creating a more resilient, women-based supply chain, a stronger and more inclusive company, and more robust, sustainable trade between our two countries.<\/p>\n<p>And this type of trade creates opportunities for people here in Ghana\u2019s North to improve their own lives and participate in the global economy and Ghana\u2019s development. And that kind of inclusive economic growth is something that I know that Ghana, the government of Ghana, and the government of the United States regard as really important to regional economic development and regional security. It\u2019s good for Ghana, it\u2019s good for the environment, and it\u2019s good for the economy.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m delighted to be a part of this ceremony \u2013 a combination of our investment in the Trade Hub, partnership in the Global Shea Alliance, and coordination with the Mastercard Foundation.\u00a0 This is exactly the kind of public-private partnership that is key to Ghana\u2019s human and economic development.<\/p>\n<p>Through Nuts For Growth, we\u2019re working together for greater impact, supporting the livelihoods of over 77,000 women shea and soya farmers, bolstering the economy in northern Ghana, and preserving shea trees that will create a Green Wall against desertification in Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>So on behalf of the U.S. Mission in Ghana, congratulations to everyone here today on these impressive accomplishments and those that are yet to come. And I\u2019ll come back and visit that tree and be thrilled to see all the people employed in the factory and beyond.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you very much!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tamale, Ghana \u2013\u00a0On her first official trip in Ghana, U.S. Ambassador Virginia Palmer visited Tamale and Northern Region this week.\u00a0 She met with peace and security, economic empowerment, public health, media, and development partners during the two-day trip. \u00a0USAID Ghana Mission Director Kimberly Rosen accompanied the Ambassador. \u201cNorthern Ghana is an absolute priority for the &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1058,"featured_media":22710,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_gpalab_slo_mission_select":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[4,37,44,61],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-22704","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-ambassador","category-news","category-press-releases","category-us-and-gh"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) -
