We\u2019re very grateful for your contributions to tonight\u2019s event and even more for what you do to innovate, upskill, and create jobs and prosperity for both Ghana and the United States. Thank you to American Tower, Cargill, GE, Hershey, Imperial Logistics, AFAM Concept, Avis, Land Tours, Accra Brewery, Delta, Federal Express, Holiday Inn, Pizza Hut (Melcom Group), KFC (Mohinani Group), Pinkberry (Quick Holdings), Modec, Rendeavour, Trimble, United, Visa, WAPCo, and Swagelok (Xost).\u00a0 (They\u2019re listed on the screens behind me.) Please sample some of the flavors from those who provided food and drink tonight (KFC!\u00a0 Pizza Hut!\u00a0 Pink Berry! Hershey Chocolate!) that make Ghana feel like home for the thousands of Americans who live and visit this beautiful country.\u00a0\u00a0 I\u2019d like to salute and thank my sensational Deputy Nicole Chulick.\u00a0 This will be her last July 4<sup>th<\/sup> in Ghana and the Mission will be much poorer without her insight and compassionate leadership.<\/li>\n<li>I\u2019d like to thank the Topside Brass Band for coming all the way from Italy to share some great jazz with all of us! Tonight, we\u2019re celebrating not just our independence but the ties that bind the U.S. and Ghana.\u00a0 One of those is music.\u00a0 And jazz, with its roots in the rich tapestry of African culture and the experience of African Americans is a powerful expression of resilience, creativity, and freedom and a testament to the incredible contributions that people of African descent have made to the world.<\/li>\n<li>Finally, I\u2019d like to thank Katie Cummings and the July 4<sup>th<\/sup> Committee she headed who put in weeks of work to make tonight\u2019s event, well, FABULOUS. Thank you all <u>very<\/u><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I\u2019m going to try to depart from the normal formula of talking at length about our bilateral programs.\u00a0 Let\u2019s just say it\u2019s been an amazing year!\u00a0 I\u2019ll highlight just three things that demonstrate the breadth of the relationship:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>we concluded work on a $390 million Millennium Challenge Compact which built power infrastructure that will make major contributions to Ghana\u2019s growth;<\/li>\n<li>The depth of our longstanding security partnership was on show when Ghana and the United States hosted Flintlock, a major military exercise involving militaries from 29 nations. And we\u2019ll soon be commissioning two ships for the Ghanaian navy and handing over a pier and millions of dollars of equipment for the Special Boats Squadron; and finally<\/li>\n<li>When Vice President Harris visited Ghana, she announced major programs on security, digitalization, and women\u2019s economic empowerment that look at Africa as a critical partner on issues which will define the global future \u2013 new technologies, climate, and democratic growth. The choice of Ghana as her first stop was intentional \u2013 acknowledging not just our historic ties, but Ghana\u2019s leadership in regional security and on the UN Security Council and her model for democratic governance.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Highlights of Vice President Harris\u2019 visit and other programs are playing on screens around the event all evening.<\/p>\n<p>I want also to acknowledge that it\u2019s been a very tough year for Ghana.\u00a0 Please know that as you implement the new IMF program and Ghana\u2019s economic recovery accelerates, the United States government, companies and people stand with you.<\/p>\n<p>The Fourth of July is a reminder that the flame of freedom burns brightly in all of us who strive for a better future.\u00a0 Ghana\u2019s own independence struggle inspired countless others in their quest for freedom \u2013 including in the United States &#8211; and your example burns bright in a time when there has been much democratic backsliding across the region.<\/p>\n<p>Together we draw inspiration from the heroes of our past\u2014the activists, the innovators, the dreamers\u2014who have pushed boundaries, battled discrimination, and changed the course of history.\u00a0 We, collectively, stand on their shoulders.\u00a0 We owe it to them to continue the fight to deliver and defend accountable, inclusive democracies that truly serve our people.<\/p>\n<p>I say deliver because we still have much to do \u2013 here and at home.\u00a0 Injustice persists.\u00a0 Misinformation provokes disorder.\u00a0 Corruption erodes confidence in public institutions and deprives citizens of basic needs and a prosperous future.\u00a0 We know that when delivery of public services falters, people lose faith in their government. \u00a0We don\u2019t have to look far to see examples of extremists taking advantage of this failure.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we work together to deliver on the promise of democracy. \u00a0The solutions to these problems \u2013 corruption, lack of faith in public institutions, the threat of extremism \u2013 lie in more democracy, not less.<\/p>\n<p>Every one of us has the power to make a difference.\u00a0 Let us stand up against corruption.\u00a0 Let us work together to promote peace, tolerance, opportunity, and inclusivity.\u00a0 Let us champion human rights for <u>all<\/u>, no matter a person\u2019s race, creed, gender, or sexual orientation.\u00a0 I hope that in the coming year business, political, and civil society leaders confront bigotry in all its forms.\u00a0 The United States needs a partner like Ghana, where human rights are recognized for their role in deepening business and social connections<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to end by quoting WEB DuBois, who battled discrimination at home, was welcomed in Ghana and is buried 100 yards from where we gather tonight:<\/p>\n<p>I believe in Liberty for all men: the space to stretch their arms and their souls; the right to breathe and the right to vote, the freedom to choose their friends, enjoy the sunshine, and ride on the railroads, uncursed by color; thinking, dreaming, working as they will in a kingdom of beauty and love.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n<p>[PAUSE]<\/p>\n<p>Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in a toast:\u00a0 to the health of His Excellency President Nana Akufo-Addo and the people of Ghana and to the values of freedom, democracy and tolerance that make our nations great.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Remarks by Ambassador Palmer Fourth of July Reception 2023 As Prepared for Delivery &nbsp;
