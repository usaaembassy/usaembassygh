Palmer U.S. Independence Day Celebration Remarks<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>July 4, 2024, U.S. Embassy Ghana<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em>As prepared for delivery<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Good evening and akwaaba! Ismail and I, and all of our colleagues here, welcome you to the U.S. Embassy for tonight\u2019s Fourth of July celebration. Before I go any further, I want to offer my enormous personal thanks to the team that organized this wonderful event.<\/p>\n<p>First, I owe a huge thanks to Katie Cummings who led a huge committee of volunteers \u2013 including Felix Anim, Teresia Kamau (our MC tonight) Sapphire Carrington, Eric Okine, Esi Bruce, Nana Poku Agyei-Sarpong, Jonathan Quaye, Charles Opoku, Danbi Lee, Ethan Abrams and the Regional Security Team to organize tonight\u2019s festivities.\u00a0 Thank you for your vision and for the months of work it took to bring all of this together.<\/p>\n<p>I also want to express my profound gratitude to Kosmos Energy, Avis, Land Tours, Delta Airlines, Piedmont Lithium, PWC, Pizza Hut (Melcom Group), KFC (Mohinani Group), Pinkberry (Quick Holdings), MAC Ghana, United Airlines, and WAPCo, (They\u2019re listed on banners throughout the venue.)\u00a0 Please sample some of the flavors from those who provided treats this evening (slices of Pizza Hut! Chicken and Milkshakes from KFC and some refreshing Fro-Yo from Pink Berry!). \u00a0Then you can wash it all down with an ice cold American-style lager from Heritage Brewery or even a shot of Fireball whiskey, another all-American favorite.\u00a0 We\u2019re so very appreciative of your contributions tonight and even more for what you do to innovate and create jobs and prosperity for both Ghana and the United States.<\/p>\n<p>You all know how we Americans love our NFL Football so we are so excited to see the growing interest in the game all over Africa and in Ghana in particular.\u00a0 I encourage you to check out the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 tent tonight; it\u2019s an excellent opportunity to test out your quarterback skills!\u00a0 And please take a minute to stop by one of the Delta Airlines\u2019 photo booths or take a selfie with Uncle Sam or the Statue of Liberty.\u00a0 Finally, thank you to the Adaha Dance Band for entertaining us tonight!\u00a0 They sure know how to party (and move!).\u00a0 I hope you\u2019ll join me later on the dance floor!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Tonight we celebrate the 248<sup>th<\/sup> anniversary of U.S. independence. And it\u2019s so special to celebrate this holiday here, with our Ghanaian friends. Because Ghana has been a part of the American story since before there even was a United States of America. The fact that our two countries\u2019 relationship began in such a horrendous chapter of human history, but has since evolved into a friendship of likeminded partners is a true testament to the values that bind Ghana and the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>Those shared values are many, but on this evening \u2013 in this election year \u2013 the two that come to mind are democracy and diversity. Democracy because it\u2019s the heartbeat of our nations, the foundation on which our countries are built. Diversity because it\u2019s the lifeblood of democracy. It\u2019s what gives democracy its value and purpose.<\/p>\n<p>One of our founding fathers, Benjamin Franklin, was once asked whether the United States had a republic or a monarchy.\u00a0 He responded, \u201cA republic\u2014if you can keep it.\u201d Franklin knew that <em>keeping<\/em> a republic, a government that remains responsive and subject to its people, is just as hard as <em>establishing<\/em> a republic. Maybe harder.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It was hard 248 years ago<\/strong> \u2013 It\u2019s important that as we sing Yankee Doodle Dandy and watch the fireworks that we remember that 12 of the 56 signers of the Declaration of Independence had their homes ransacked and burned. Two lost their sons in the Revolutionary Army. Nine fought and died from wounds or hardships of the Revolutionary War.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It\u2019s hard today<\/strong>. We see neighbors in West Africa struggling with democratic backsliding and coups. We see our adversaries attempting to divide and conquer by eroding public trust in our governments, our democratic institutions. We see extremists exploiting inequalities and injustices. In some places we see attempts to silence voters. To spread disinformation. Perhaps most importantly\u2014it\u2019s hard to get our citizens to forget that though we may disagree on how to get there, we are all trying to reach the same place: that more perfect union. <em>E pluribus unum.<\/em> Out of many, one.<\/p>\n<p>This journey is always difficult, but in 2024? During this election year, for both Ghana and the U.S.? Phew. Elections are messy. They\u2019re loud, they\u2019re chaotic, and they\u2019re downright exhausting. But you know what? If an election is done right, that\u2019s how it should be. Elections are messy because they\u2019re inclusive. They\u2019re loud and chaotic because everyone is using their voice, trusting they will be heard. Elections are exhausting because they\u2019re worth fighting for.\u00a0 I want to salute President Akufo-Addo\u2019s oft expressed commitment \u2013 echoed by the flagbearers and candidates too \u2013 that Ghana\u2019s elections will be free, transparent, fair and credible.<\/p>\n<p>Elections are especially worth fighting for in Ghana and the U.S. because of the incredible diversity our two countries have in common. Now, that word, \u201cdiversity,\u201d gets thrown around a lot, so let me tell you what it means to me.<\/p>\n<p>It means that on any given day in the U.S., every person you interact with\u2014that Ethiopian coffee shop owner. Your Jewish neighbor. Your Ghanaian doctor. The folks on the bus speaking a dozen languages you don\u2019t understand. Your brother who argues with you about every issue in the news\u2014you know that each of those individuals will have a say at the ballot box. Each of their voices will count as much as yours in deciding the direction of your country.<\/p>\n<p>This may sound familiar to Ghanaians because this is also a country that is famously, proudly diverse. You\u2019ve got over 90 ethnic groups, speaking over 80 languages, spread across 16 regions, governing with more than a dozen political parties, practicing several religions\u2014and everyone\u2019s got a different opinion. So how do such diverse countries as ours ensure that our democracies continue to flourish, that our governments don\u2019t succumb to those who attempt to discredit, disillusion, divide? That discrimination doesn\u2019t erode the practice of democracy and our democratic principles.<\/p>\n<p>The answer lies in the question: we embrace our diversity. Because we recognize that the best solution is found when we look at the problem through a multitude of perspectives. We arrive at the best ideas when they are tested, argued, and refined in the crucible of a free press <em>and <\/em>the halls of parliament.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. and Ghana are doing just that. \u00a0I\u2019m proud of what we\u2019ve achieved in just the last year. With Operation Flintlock, Ghana stepped up to host the armed forces of 31 nations in an exercise to strengthen security in the region\u2014so critical at this time of rising extremism in the Sahel. When flooding in the Volta region destroyed homes and livelihoods, Ghana came together as Ghanaians and the U.S. was proud to assist both those in immediate need and children returning to school in the aftermath of the disaster. And with our Embassy on track to set another record in adjudicating student visa applications this year, American universities will benefit from the seriously impressive students that Ghana produces\u2014who will, in turn, use their American education to become the scientists, journalists, and leaders of tomorrow\u2019s Ghana and strengthen the bridges between our two great countries.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s still more to do, and this year will test the democracies of both our republics. But if we uphold the democratic institutions that have remained a bulwark of our countries; draw upon our diversity as our strength, not a liability; and insist on the rights of our fellow citizens to voice their opinions and dissent, even as we disagree with them\u2014our republics will be in good hands. I believe we can \u201ckeep\u201d them. Thank you.<\/p>\n<p>Now, please join me in a toast: To the good health of His Excellency President Nana Akufo-Addo, to the people of Ghana, and to the values of diversity, democracy, and freedom that make our nations great.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>U.S. Ambassador Virginia E.
