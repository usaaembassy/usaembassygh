Jackson<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>U.S. Embassy Accra <\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Wednesday, July 4, 2018 | 6 p.m.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Your Excellency, the Vice President of Ghana, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia,<\/p>\n<p>Honorable U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross,<\/p>\n<p>Honorable Minister for Lands and Natural Resources John Peter Amewu,<\/p>\n<p>Honorable Ministers and Deputy Ministers of State,<\/p>\n<p>Honorable Members of the Council of State and of Parliament,<\/p>\n<p>Your Excellencies and Dear Colleagues from the Diplomatic Corps,<\/p>\n<p>Ni Me, Na Me, Nana Nom, Traditional and Religious Leaders,<\/p>\n<p>Mission Colleagues,<\/p>\n<p>Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen,<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Akwaaba!\u00a0 Babs and I, along with my outgoing Deputy Chief of Mission, Melinda Tabler-Stone; my incoming Deputy Chief of Mission, Christopher Lamora; and all our colleagues, welcome you to the U.S. Embassy.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Tonight we celebrate the 242nd anniversary of U.S. independence.\u00a0 We honor the pioneers who first came to the United States for religious liberty and economic opportunity.\u00a0 We honor the long tradition of immigrants \u2014 from every nation on earth \u2014 who have enriched our country.\u00a0 And we reaffirm that we will continue seeking to form that more perfect Union, establish Justice, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As we considered our theme for this year, I kept coming back to New Orleans.\u00a0 It is one of my favorite cities, in part because, to me, the spirit of New Orleans represents the spirit of America.\u00a0 New Orleans is a vibrant, diverse city that embraces its historic influences \u2014 French, Spanish, African American, and many others from around the world.\u00a0 It is a city that has bounced back from tragedy, demonstrating the resiliency of our people, and the belief that \u2014 together \u2014 we can overcome challenges and move forward.\u00a0 It is a city that knows how to celebrate life and to let the good times roll.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I see some of that same spirit here in Ghana \u2014 in the way Ghanaians blend modern and traditional Africa; in the way you keep leading the region forward; and, most importantly, in Ghana\u2019s celebrated religious, linguistic, and ethnic tolerance.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Today we also mark 61 years of partnership between the United States and Ghana.\u00a0 Our relationship began centuries ago, at one of the lowest points in history.\u00a0 But our shared heritage serves as a reminder that we can overcome historic evils and create new beginnings.\u00a0 We are as close today as we have ever been.\u00a0 More than 13,000 Americans have made Ghana their home.\u00a0 More than 2,000 Americans study at Ghanaian universities.\u00a0 Thousands more visit every year.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>An even greater number of Ghanaians have made their homes in the United States.\u00a0 More than 3,000 Ghanaian students are enrolled at American colleges and universities.\u00a0 Tourists travel back and forth every day, as do entrepreneurs seeking new commercial opportunities.\u00a0 Thanks in part to them, our bilateral trade exceeded $1.6 billion in 2017.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I am honored that Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross is joining us tonight.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, your visit is evidence of the importance the U.S. government places on strengthening trade relations with Ghana.\u00a0 As the gateway to Africa, Ghana plays a key role for U.S. companies developing their presence on the continent.\u00a0 KFC, Hertz and Avis have been operating in Ghana for years.\u00a0 Since I arrived, many others have joined this market \u2014 Pizza Hut, Harley-Davidson, Pinkberry, Uber and, most recently, Burger King \u2014 to name just a few.\u00a0 We are proud of the commercial successes we have achieved together.\u00a0 I am particularly proud of the principles of transparency and corporate social responsibility observed by American companies around the world.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>These investments create employment opportunities for Ghanaians and help stimulate economic growth and development.\u00a0 At the same time, Ghanaian entrepreneurs \u2014 many of them beneficiaries of U.S. government exchange programs \u2014 are creating new opportunities across the country.\u00a0 A thriving, prosperous Ghana is in America\u2019s national security interest.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As I close my diplomatic career and prepare to become a private citizen, let me affirm what a special privilege it has been for me to represent the United States of America.\u00a0 I have always believed that my purpose was to make people\u2019s lives better, and that by channeling the resources of the U.S. government, I could help others be healthier, better educated, more prosperous and more secure.\u00a0 That is what has motivated me to get up and go to work every morning of my career.\u00a0 I enjoy serving in Africa because, over the course of two or three years, you can really see the results of your work.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to highlight what, to me, are the most meaningful successes of the past two-and-a-half years.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As a former teacher, I believe deeply in the importance of education and literacy.\u00a0 I am so proud of our Partnership for Education program with the Ministry of Education.\u00a0 Over the past two years, we have reached 700,000 primary school students with approximately five million books and teacher training aids, to help children learn to read in 11 indigenous languages and English.\u00a0 We have trained more than 30,000 Ghanaian educators in phonics and reading.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I am also proud of our health partnership, which has saved countless lives.\u00a0 Ghanaian citizens are leading normal, productive lives thanks to antiretroviral care funded by the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. \u00a0Malaria-related deaths have declined dramatically.\u00a0 Maternal and child health care services have significantly improved.\u00a0 I congratulate Ghana for becoming the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to eliminate trachoma, a contagious bacterial eye infection that afflicted many people.\u00a0 These successes have been earned by Ghana\u2019s health professionals, and by successive governments from <u>both<\/u> major parties who believe in the strength of our partnerships for health.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As I mentioned last year at this time, Ghana demonstrated its military leadership and professionalism by becoming the first African partner nation to train U.S. Army forces.\u00a0 With our new Defense Cooperation Agreement, we will continue to work side by side to address threats to global peace and security.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Finally, I am proud that we are making unreliable electricity a problem of the past.\u00a0 Through our Millennium Challenge Power Compact, Ghanaians will have reliable and affordable energy \u2014 energy that will promote greater industrialization and opportunities to add value to Ghana\u2019s exports.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In short:\u00a0 The United States is working with Ghana to build a bright future.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As I close, I want to sincerely thank the people of Ghana for the warm welcome and friendship you have offered me.\u00a0 To my embassy team \u2013 American and Ghanaian:\u00a0 Your service makes the United States \u2014 and me \u2014 very proud.\u00a0 I particularly thank my extraordinary deputy, Melinda Tabler-Stone, and welcome her successor, Chris Lamora.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Special thanks go to Margaret Langer, Maurice Jackson, and all of the other people who worked so hard to make this event a success.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I must also extend my deepest gratitude to all the sponsors who made this year\u2019s Independence Day celebration possible, through their generous contributions:\u00a0 African Aviation\/American Airlines, American Tower, American Products Company Ltd., Authentix, Aviation Alliance

thank my wife and my best friend. \u00a0Babs, you have been by my side on this journey of service \u2014 year after year, country after country.\u00a0 We have seen the world, and the world has seen the goodness of America through you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Now, please join me in a toast: \u00a0To the good health and long life of His Excellency President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo \u2014 to the United States, and to Ghana.\u00a0 May the friendship and partnership between our nations continue to grow.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Ladies and gentlemen, It is now my distinct
