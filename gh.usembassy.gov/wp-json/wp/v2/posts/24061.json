I was saying to him that I am in the middle of reading [his book] <\/span><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Ill Winds: Saving Democracy from Russian Rage, Chinese Ambition, and American Complacency.\u00a0 <\/span><\/i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">I don\u2019t want to steal your thunder, but you see, that title stings a little bit and a think it\u2019s because it\u2019s so close to the bone.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">I am conscious as the Ambassador that the United States and Ghana have their elections almost at the same time\u2026that democracy is not something we say check \u2013 accomplished and then move on to enjoy.\u00a0\u00a0 We have to fight for and protect it every day.\u00a0 We have to fight injustice and discrimination.\u00a0 We have to fight encroachment on democratic institutions.\u00a0 We have to beef up the institutions that are responsible for delivering democracy.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">We must not think about it just in terms of the ballot box, we have to think about it in terms of governance and delivery of service, inclusive economic growth, justice for our citizens, and only then will democracy be safe.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Organizations in Ghana such as the National Peace Council, the National Commission on Civic Education, the Electoral Commission, and the Ghana Police Service play critical roles in Ghana elections.\u00a0 The National Peace Council and the National Commission on Civic Education are two uniquely Ghanaian institutions that could \u2013 and should \u2013 be copied around the world.\u00a0 Their efforts ensure that the voice of the Ghanaian people is not only heard, but also respected and acted upon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">However, we find ourselves at a moment in which democracy\u2019s strength is being tested around the world, especially here in West Africa. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In recent years, some parts of West Africa have witnessed a distressing decline in democratic norms and weakening of democratic institutions.\u00a0 This decline has been characterized by a resurgence of authoritarian regimes, a rise in violent extremism, pervasive corruption, alarming human rights abuses by security forces, discrimination against minorities, restrictions on press freedom and free speech, and a failure to share economic prosperity equitably.\u00a0 These factors not only undermine the fabric of democracy but also erode trust in the very institutions meant to safeguard human rights.\u00a0 Those countries that stepped away from democracy are now even less secure than they were before their democratically elected governments were replaced by military juntas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">On multiple occasions we\u2019ve seen rampant and state-sponsored disinformation used to manufacture narratives and spread false information that undermines elected governments.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259,&quot;469777462&quot;:[1155],&quot;469777927&quot;:[0],&quot;469777928&quot;:[1]}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">That\u2019s not to say these West African elected governments were perfect, they weren\u2019t.\u00a0 I think something that\u2019s very important today is the need for consistency in calling out attacks on democracy.\u00a0 Not just by soldiers but by all kinds of people and with disinformation, corruption, and discrimination.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259,&quot;469777462&quot;:[1155],&quot;469777927&quot;:[0],&quot;469777928&quot;:[1]}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The massive onslaught of disinformation undermined their democratically elected government mandate, accelerated their downfalls, and made life for the citizens of those countries more complicated, not less.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A study by the Africa Center for Strategic Studies released earlier this month found that disinformation campaigns in Africa have surged nearly four-fold since 2022.\u00a0 That\u2019s 189 documented disinformation campaigns in Africa, of those nineteen campaigns have targeted Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger since 2018. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Make no mistake, disinformation is not the only reason for the decline of democracy in West Africa.\u00a0 It\u2019s also about the inability of elected governments to deliver on their promises, share economic prosperity, fight corruption, uphold the rule of law, bolster democratic institutions, improve security, and deliver for the people. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">And I used to think there was a continuum between security and liberty and democracy.\u00a0 I have come to realize that it\u2019s not really that simple. I used to think that mothers and fathers would make a choice to surrender some liberties to protect their children, but in the end it\u2019s not that simple.\u00a0 Discrimination against minorities causes grievances and makes those groups vulnerable to recruitment by violent extremists, for example, which can then create a downward spiral for security. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Corruption also undermines the institutions that protect security and again creates a vicious downward spiral. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">When a democratic government fails to live up to expectations, the solution is MORE democracy, NOT LESS.\u00a0 That\u2019s important to remind people.\u00a0 Millions of people around the world living under less free regimes still clamor for democracy every day.\u00a0 Still, as we\u2019ve seen around the world, democracy can be fragile.\u00a0 It needs to be protected and it needs to deliver for the people. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">President Biden has made the defense of democracy a core pillar of American diplomacy.\u00a0 Just last week, Secretary of State Blinken attended the third Summit for Democracy in Seoul, South Korea.\u00a0 President Biden launched the first Summit for Democracy in 2021 as a forum to share ideas and organize collective action to address emerging challenges to democracy.\u00a0 At this year\u2019s Summit, Secretary Blinken highlighted collective and individual countries\u2019 efforts to fight corruption, promote free and fair elections, protect independent media and journalists, and uphold and defend human rights. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Building a strong, inclusive economy is also one of the best ways to support our democratic principles.\u00a0 Through multi-year implementation of the Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability (SPCPS), the United States is working to do that in Coastal West Africa.\u00a0 We focus those efforts in Ghana on inclusive economic growth and projection of state services in Ghana\u2019s much poorer north and to the protection and inclusion of vulnerable populations on Ghana\u2019s borders. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">As we look ahead to the upcoming presidential elections in both the United States and Ghana, we must reaffirm our commitment to the principles that underpin a democratic society.\u00a0 Democracy can triumph over adversity through the promotion of shared economic prosperity, the conduct of free and fair elections, the inclusion of minorities in public policy debates, and the maintenance of well-trained security forces that can counter violent extremists while protecting human rights.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">My team at the U.S. Embassy is working with journalists, government officials, local communities, underrepresented groups, and civil society organizations (like those the ones who organized this forum) to support free and fair elections in Ghana that truly deliver for the people.\u00a0 Because free and fair elections here and in the United States will continue to be a sign to the rest of the world that democracy is alive and well.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259,&quot;469777462&quot;:[1155],&quot;469777927&quot;:[0],&quot;469777928&quot;:[1]}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">I look forward to the conversations today and thank you again.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ambassador Palmer Remarks at CDD\u2019s Democracy Decline in West Africa: A Conversation with Policy Actors March 26, 2024 Remarks As Delivered\u00a0 Good morning!\u00a0 Thank you and I am honored to be here at a forum organized by really important Ghanaian organizations \u2013 the Center for Democratic Development, the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Center and &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1058,"featured_media":24064,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_gpalab_slo_mission_select":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[4,54],"tags":[10026,10120,10118,10116],"class_list":["post-24061","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-ambassador","category-speeches","tag-ambassador-palmer","tag-democracy","tag-remarks","tag-speeches"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) -
