This is thanks, in part, to the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which significantly enhances market access to the United States for qualifying Sub-Saharan African countries like Ghana. In case there is any doubt, AGOA is alive and well and has been renewed until the year 2025. \u00a0In addition, this increase is a testament to our team\u2019s collaboration with Ghanaian exporters through the West Africa Trade and Investment Hub, which has been working with apparel manufacturers to increase Ghanaian exports to the United States.\u00a0 Apparel exports to the United States reached $18 million US dollars in 2019, up from just $570,000 dollars in 2010. \u00a0And Ghana is now the largest West African apparel exporter to the United States.<\/p>\n<p>These statistics indicate a strengthening relationship and reflect our shared interest in expanding trade and investment between our two nations.\u00a0 The United States also looks forward to the establishment here in Accra of the Secretariat of the African Continental Free Trade Area.\u00a0 As noted in the joint statement between the United States and the African Union at the AGOA Forum in Abidjan last year, we look forward to working with the Secretariat to build a continental trade partnership between the United States and Africa that supports regional integration.<\/p>\n<p>After all, <em><strong>\u201c<\/strong><\/em><strong><em>Wamma wo yonko anntwa anko a, wonntwa nnuru\u201d<\/em> \u2013 <\/strong>If you don\u2019t let your friend cross and reach (his or her destination), you will also not cross and reach yours.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why we all must continue to work together to create the environment in which Ghanaian and other businesses will thrive. \u00a0It\u2019s the entrepreneurial spirit in Ghana that delivers economic successes, and it\u2019s the people who own and run small businesses who create jobs, raise incomes, and help communities reach their potential.<\/p>\n<p>As we all know, COVID-19 has brought unprecedented challenges to the global economy and to entrepreneurs.\u00a0 Ghana has not been immune. \u00a0But I\u2019ve been impressed with how thoughtful, innovative, adaptive, and supportive local entrepreneurs have been in pivoting their production to help combat the virus, weathering its economic disruptions, and protecting their employees and wider communities at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>In recent weeks, I\u2019ve met with Ghanaian women who are alumnae of United States government programs that support local entrepreneurs, including the African Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship Program (AWEP) and the Academy of Women Entrepreneurs (AWE), which is a key part of the White House\u2019s Women\u2019s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to share with you just a couple of the inspiring stories I heard.<\/p>\n<p>One alumna owns a fitness business with the goal of helping women lead healthy lifestyles.\u00a0 Through our AWE program, whose motto is \u201cWomen without Limits,\u201d\u00a0she increased her confidence in her entrepreneurial abilities.\u00a0 When COVID-19 hit, she developed a Zoom workout program that more than tripled her client base from 60 to 200, with online customers stretching across Africa and all the way to the United States.<\/p>\n<p>Another participant realized that fashion was not going to be a priority during a global health crisis; so, she applied her skills to a more essential business.\u00a0 In collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture and partners in her rural hometown, she pivoted to grain production, meeting a demand for nutritious staples, generating revenue, and improving Ghana\u2019s food security.<\/p>\n<p>These and many similar examples of Ghanaian ingenuity give me confidence that we will overcome the challenges of COVID-19.\u00a0 I look forward to a better future in which we are partnering even more closely to achieve our shared goals of expanding two-way trade and investment, recovering from this pandemic, and bolstering Ghana\u2019s already vibrant entrepreneurial spirit. With your leadership, dedication, and collaboration, I know we can succeed.<\/p>\n<p>Congratulations once again to the Entrepreneurs Foundation on ten years of building Ghanaian businesses! And congratulations to all of tonight\u2019s nominees and, of course, to all the winners. Your achievements are something special for us to celebrate tonight.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Remarks by Ambassador Stephanie S.
