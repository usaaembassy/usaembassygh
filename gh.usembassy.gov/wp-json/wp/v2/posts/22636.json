Akufo-Addo<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>June 16, 2022\u00a0 \u00a0 Jubilee House<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Your Excellency, President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, I\u2019m honored to be here as President Biden\u2019s representative in Ghana. \u00a0Thank you for the welcome you have given me and my husband Ismail.\u00a0 Over the next three years, I look forward to seeing as much of this beautiful country as possible and meeting Ghanaians from all walks of life.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m proud to represent the United States in Ghana. \u00a0Ghana is a true leader in Africa and far beyond.\u00a0 Secretary Blinken said in November that \u201cwe can\u2019t achieve our goals around the world \u2013 whether that\u2019s ending the COVID-19 pandemic, building a strong and inclusive global economy, combating the climate crisis, or revitalizing democracy and defending human rights \u2013 without the leadership of African governments, institutions, and citizens.\u201d\u00a0 We remain grateful for Ghana\u2019s leadership in all these areas and its efforts to promote regional and global peace and security, health and prosperity through its significant contributions to global peacekeeping and leadership in the Economic Community of West African States, the African Union, and the United Nations Security Council.<\/p>\n<p>I also honor what Ghana has meant historically to the United States and at its independence in 1957, when it was a beacon not just for other African countries seeking freedom from colonial rule but also for American civil rights activists seeking justice and equal rights in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>Today the U.S.-Ghana partnership is stronger than ever, founded on these historic ties and our shared democratic values and strengthened by our vibrant bilateral trade and investment and strong security cooperation.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. President, during my tenure in Ghana, I will give my all to supporting Ghana\u2019s work to achieve inclusive and sustainable economic growth, equitable health outcomes, accountable governance, human rights for all, and peace and security for Ghana and its neighbors.<\/p>\n<p>Today, I\u2019d like to briefly highlight our mutual successes and my hopes for the coming months and years:<\/p>\n<p>The pandemic colored much of the past two years but has also brought us closer as friends and partners.\u00a0 COVID-19 highlighted how the infrastructure and the relationships we\u2019ve built over decades of partnership helped Ghana react quickly and effectively to the pandemic. \u00a0The U.S. government provided over $54 million in support for Ghana\u2019s COVID-19 response and more than 12 million vaccine doses. We\u2019ll continue to work with the Ghana Health Service to increase vaccination rates.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve seen two-way trade between the United States and Ghana grow to $2.7 billion in 2021.\u00a0 Even during the pandemic, American companies like Twitter, Orrin Pest Control, Pizza Hut, Domino\u2019s Pizza, and Kosmos Energy were opening or expanding in Ghana.\u00a0 U.S. businesses bring world-class innovation, operate with transparency, transfer knowledge, respect local labor laws, and create jobs. \u00a0Last year, the Department of State recognized Zipline with the Secretary\u2019s Award for Corporate Excellence for its innovative work to deliver perishable medical supplies, including COVID-19 and other vaccines, via its fleet of fixed-wing drones in Ghana.\u00a0 Since opening in Ghana in 2019, Zipline has expanded to six distribution centers in remote areas of the country, making Ghana home to the world\u2019s largest fleet of medical-delivery drones. \u00a0Your work to ensure a favorable and predictable business climate free from the scourge of corruption will bring even more American investment and trade to Ghana.\u00a0 Indeed, the U.S.-Ghana Business Forum is going on as I present my credentials and our number two U.S. commercial official, Deputy Secretary of Commerce Don Graves, is here with a delegation from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce &#8211; a clear sign of the U.S. government and U.S. private sector\u2019s commitment to growing the trade and investment relationship.\u00a0 His visit follows on your meeting at the White House with Vice President Harris and Secretary Blinken\u2019s meeting with His Excellency Vice President Bawumia in February.<\/p>\n<p>With the Secretariat of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement based in Accra, Ghana is in position to lead and benefit from intra-Africa trade and the United States stands ready to support the critical economic integration the AfCFTA aims to foster. The African Growth and Opportunity Act, which allows almost two thousand Ghanaian products duty-free entry into the U.S. market, is another tool to foster Ghana\u2019s economic growth.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier this month, we marked the completion of Ghana\u2019s second Millennium Challenge Corporation Compact, a $316 million grant to build new power infrastructure, including the Pokuase and Kasoa Bulk Supply Points and Ellen Moran Primary Substation; energy efficiency programs; and wider opportunities for women in the power sector. \u00a0I\u2019ll work with you to try to secure a subsequent Compact for Ghana, Mr. President. The MCC Board of Directors sets a high bar when deciding which countries to select for a compact.\u00a0 Ghana\u2019s MCC scorecard is strong, but we\u2019ll need to demonstrate that power sector reforms have been completed and that the infrastructure of the MCC Ghana Power Compact is sustained and continues to bring reliable electricity to Ghanaian households and businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Inclusive and sustainable economic growth depends also on equitable health outcomes for Ghana\u2019s population. \u00a0That\u2019s why we support Ghana\u2019s HIV\/AIDS response through PEPFAR, the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, as well as the U.S. President\u2019s Malaria Initiative, maternal and child health, and nutrition programs.\u00a0 Our recently launched $45 million project to improve water, sanitation, and hygiene services in northern Ghana will enable community development and allow children to go to school instead of walking miles to find water each day.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve also invested in programs for women by helping expand the shea industry in Ghana and neighboring countries, increasing the incomes of hundreds of thousands of rural women.\u00a0 We support women-owned businesses through the Academy for Women Entrepreneurs because we know that when women succeed, their families thrive, their communities develop, and their nations flourish. \u00a0We share your concern for youth, Ghana\u2019s future, and support a growing number of programs for young professionals to build civil society capacity and promote good governance and accountability.<\/p>\n<p>We applaud Ghana\u2019s leadership in providing a strong example of democracy, not only in the region, but also across the world.\u00a0 The U.S. government continues to be a steady partner of Ghana to ensure this hard-won reputation is maintained.\u00a0 We will work with you to uphold accountable governance and show how democracy can deliver what citizens want, quickly and effectively.<\/p>\n<p>We will also continue our close partnership with the Ghana Armed Forces through training, exercises, and technical support. \u00a0We will work with our Ghanaian partners to improve cybersecurity, maritime, and border security; combat transnational organized crime, trafficking in persons and narcotics; and build capacity within Ghana\u2019s law enforcement and justice sector.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, one great and very tangible symbol of our partnership is that Ghana was the first country to welcome U.S. Peace Corps Volunteers.\u00a0 Peace Corps Volunteers are our real Ambassadors, learning about Ghana and sharing their knowledge with your children and communities.\u00a0 I\u2019m delighted that after a pandemic-induced hiatus, Peace Corps Volunteers will return to Ghana this month!<\/p>\n<p>When we look back to this day, I trust we will say that the relationship is stronger than ever and that together the United States of America and the Republic of Ghana have each benefited from our friendship, trade, and exchange.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">###<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Accra, GHANA \u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/our-relationship\/u-s-ambassador-to-ghana-virginia-e-palmer\/\">U.S. Ambassador to Ghana Virginia Palmer<\/a> presented her credentials to President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo June 16, 2022 at Jubilee House.
