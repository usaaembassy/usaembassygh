><\/div><p><strong>Accra, GHANA<\/strong> &#8211; The United States and the Government of Ghana launched a joint $25 million partnership to improve health services in Ghana earlier today.\u00a0 United States Agency for International Development (USAID)\/Ghana Mission Director Kimberly Rosen joined the Director General of the Ghana Health Service (GHS) Dr. Patrick Kuma-Aboagye to formally launch the five-year agreement at a ceremony at the GHS headquarters in Accra.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cInvestments in health pay back dividends for generations.\u00a0 The partnership we announced today will help provide quality services to all Ghanaians, no matter\u00a0 where they live or how much they can afford to pay,\u201d stated USAID\/Ghana Mission Director Kimberly Rosen, during the agreement launch ceremony.<\/p>\n<p>The Government-to-Government (G2G) agreement will support the Ghana Health Service to improve the quality of primary health care delivery at community health facilities (CHPS) and health centers.\u00a0 USAID will provide $18.8 million in funding while the GHS is expected to contribute $6.2 million over five years.\u00a0 This is USAID\/Ghana\u2019s largest G2G agreement in the health sector to date.<\/p>\n<p>\u2018\u2019We believe that this support is going to help us to continue to provide quality care and also enhance our patient experience through the network of practice as we march towards achieving universal health coverage\u2019\u2019 noted Director General of Ghana Health Service, Dr. Patrick Kuma-Aboagye.<\/p>\n<p>The United States Government is Ghana\u2019s largest bilateral partner with over $150 million in support in the last year for health, economic growth, agriculture, education, governance, security, and more. \u00a0This five-year agreement aligns with the Government of Ghana&#8217;s health objectives, including the Universal Health Coverage Roadmap (2020-2030).\u00a0 USAID and the GHS will support 60 Networks of Practice (NoP) in the five regions of the north and in the Western Region with essential equipment, training of health staff, and on-the-job supportive supervision to strengthen their skills.\u00a0 The Network of Practice (NoP) model links community health facilities to district health centers for improved healthcare delivery.\u00a0 The agreement will also support the GHS to operationalize their Planning and Budgeting Management Information System and the Ministry of Finance for its Integrated Financial Management Information System, among others.<\/p>\n<p>During the launch ceremony, the USAID\/Ghana Mission Director also handed over three Yamaha motorcycles to the GHS to support community health officers to access hard-to-reach areas.\u00a0 Over the past year, USAID has donated more than 300 motorcycles, 20 vehicles, and 3,000 electronic tablets to the GHS to facilitate health service delivery.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>About USAID<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>USAID is the lead U.S. Government agency that works to end extreme global poverty and enable resilient, democratic societies to realize their potential.\u00a0 USAID&#8217;s activities and strategic partnerships support Ghana to advance an integrated approach to development.\u00a0 It promotes accountability, sustainable systems, and inclusive development.<\/p>\n<p>January 23,
