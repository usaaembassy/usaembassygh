Cybersecurity Awareness Month is a great opportunity to renew that commitment.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, today the United States is launching our own campaign for Cybersecurity Awareness Month.\u00a0 For us, the theme is \u201cDo Your Part; Be Cyber Smart.\u201d\u00a0 While the slogans may be different, the intent behind Cybersecurity Awareness Month, both here in Ghana and in the United States, is the same \u2013 to enlist <u>all<\/u> digital technology users, including children, educators, business leaders, and government officials and entities, in the collective effort of cybersecurity.<\/p>\n<p>I would like to once again thank everyone for participating, not only in today\u2019s launch, but also in the many activities the planning team has lined up for the month ahead.\u00a0 The upcoming agenda reflects the inclusive, multi-stakeholder approach that Ghana has adopted in the pursuit of cybersecurity goals, and the United States is honored to work with our good friends in this effort.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As Prepared Remarks\u00a0by\u00a0CDA\u00a0Christopher\u00a0J.
