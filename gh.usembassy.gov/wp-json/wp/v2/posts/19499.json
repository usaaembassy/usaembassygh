Kennedy when he created the Peace Corps in 1961. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I have to tell you, as I look at them I remember my own years as a Peace Corps Volunteer in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, then named Zaire, so long ago. \u00a0From my own experience I can say that this experience will positively transform the 34 lives present today. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Each of them have completed 10 weeks of training and are now prepared to transition to being Peace Corps Volunteers. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The trainees taking the oath today will join nearly 5,000 other Americans who have served as Peace Corps Volunteers in Ghana over the past 58 years. \u00a0While this ceremony today recognizes this group, it is also a tribute to the legacy of earlier Volunteers. It is a tribute to the long, unbroken record of Volunteers working alongside Ghanaians \u2014 engaged in development challenges and increasing mutual understanding, goodwill and friendship. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Even though it has been 58 years, this relationship continues to thrive, and remains highly valued by both countries. \u00a0Volunteers\u2019 work has changed over the years in response to evolving development challenges. Regardless of the nature of the challenges, Volunteers are highly effective working at the grassroots level \u2014 in communities throughout Ghana, and with organizations that work on a daily basis to improve the lives of the Ghanaian people. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Our ideas and ideals \u2014 expressed through individuals working in partnership \u2014 have extraordinary impact. \u00a0I see this every day in our development programs in Ghana, where we change and save lives through our agriculture, education, governance, health, water and sanitation, and security programs. \u00a0I see it in the exchange programs we facilitate, including the Young African Leaders Initiative. Under the flagship program, the Mandela Washington Fellowship, young leaders from Africa hone their skills at U. S. colleges and universities, and return to the continent to craft solutions \u2014 in Africa, for Africa, by Africans. \u00a0We follow the principle of helping people gain the capacity to help themselves. Peace Corps is at the front line of that work. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We do this because a stable, prosperous and democratic Ghana is good for Ghanaians and good for America. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Our Peace Corps Volunteers are among the best and brightest that the United States has to offer. \u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now I turn my attention to the 34 Volunteers here today. \u00a0While you are here, you will serve as grassroots ambassadors. \u00a0Working diligently in your communities, you will touch lives in unimaginable ways. Through your actions and attitudes, your service and your kindness to others, you will show that Americans care deeply about Ghanaians and are committed to work side-by-side for the long term. \u00a0\u00a0You will make clear in a tangible way how much we respect and cherish our relationship with Ghana. In fact, you have already done so by taking your Pre-Service training seriously and immersing yourselves in the lives of your host families. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Peace Corps staff has done its best to give you the tools to be effective agents of change and to link communities to development resources. \u00a0\u00a0But those tools \u2014 the training, the language, the cross cultural exchanges \u2014 are just that: tools. YOU are the change agents. You are the ones who can decide to put in that extra effort to develop relationships and gain community acceptance of new ideas. \u00a0You can find new approaches and new knowledge that will help make your community a more productive and happier place. The people you interact with will help shape the future of this country, and they<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> will<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> remember you. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">About 20 years ago, Sargent Shriver, the brother-in-law of President Kennedy and first director of the Peace Corps, spoke to the graduating class at Yale University. \u00a0\u00a0As these students embarked on their new lives, just as you are embarking on yours, he told them: <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI hope you remember to believe in things until you die. \u00a0I hope you remember to be guided by beliefs powerful enough to change the world. \u00a0\u00a0I hope you remember the example of the Peace Corps Volunteer, the Head Start parent, the Special Olympics athlete. \u00a0They, each in their own way are waging peace.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I challenge you today: Wage peace. \u00a0Make a difference \u2026. One person at a time. \u00a0You may never be in a better position to do so. \u00a0And your impact will live on long after your service in Ghana ends. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now, please rise for the oath. Raise your right hand and repeat after me: <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>I (State your name), solemnly swear (or affirm) <\/em><\/strong><br \/>\n<strong><em>That I will support and defend <\/em><\/strong><br \/>\n<strong><em>the Constitution of the United States <\/em><\/strong><br \/>\n<strong><em>against all enemies, foreign and domestic, <\/em><\/strong><br \/>\n<strong><em>and that I will bear true faith <\/em><\/strong><br \/>\n<strong><em>and allegiance to the same, <\/em><\/strong><br \/>\n<strong><em>That I take this obligation freely, <\/em><\/strong><br \/>\n<strong><em>without any mental reservation<\/em><\/strong><br \/>\n<strong><em>Or purpose of evasion,<\/em><\/strong><br \/>\n<strong><em>And that I will well and faithfully discharge<\/em><\/strong><br \/>\n<strong><em>My duties in the Peace Corps, (so help me God).<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now let me turn to the Country Director of the Peace Corps to administer the Pledge. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><b>I, (state your name), promise to service alongside the people of Ghana. <\/b><\/em><br \/>\n<em><b>I promise to share my culture<\/b><\/em><br \/>\n<em><b>With an open heart and open mind. <\/b><\/em><br \/>\n<em><b>I promise to foster an understanding<\/b><\/em><br \/>\n<em><b>Of the people of Ghana,<\/b><\/em><br \/>\n<em><b>With creativity, cultural sensitivity, and respect. <\/b><\/em><br \/>\n<em><b>I will face the challenges of service<\/b><\/em><br \/>\n<em><b>With patience, humility, and determination. <\/b><\/em><br \/>\n<em><b>I will embrace the mission of world peace \u00a0\u00a0<\/b><\/em><br \/>\n<em><b>And friendship for as long as I serve and beyond. <\/b><\/em><br \/>\n<em><b>In the proud tradition of Peace Corps\u2019 legacy,<\/b><\/em><br \/>\n<em><b>And in the spirit of the Peace Corps family past, present, and future. <\/b><\/em><br \/>\n<b><em>I am a Peace Corps Volunteer.<\/em> <\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Congratulations.
