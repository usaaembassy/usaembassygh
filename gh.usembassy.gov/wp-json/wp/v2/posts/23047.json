Rosen joined Ghana\u2019s Minister of Education Dr. Yaw Adutwum this week to conclude the USAID Partnership for Education: Learning Activity.\u00a0 This eight-year partnership supported the Ministry of Education (MOE) to improve the reading skills of students in 11 Ghanaian languages and English.\u00a0 Since 2014, the project has trained more than 68,000 teachers, headteachers, and curriculum leads and reached over 750,000 students from kindergarten 2 to basic 2 in more than 7,200 schools across Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cReading at an early age improves educational outcomes and long-term livelihoods, benefiting communities across Ghana.\u00a0 USAID has demonstrated our commitment to supporting the Ministry and strengthening the human and institutional capacity of its agencies to improve children\u2019s reading performance.\u00a0 The U.S. government and Ministry\u2019s partnership is an established one. Together these past eight years, we bore significant fruit. The $97 million dollar Learning activity was judged by an external evaluation to improve students\u2019 reading abilities by a tenfold increase in average words per minute\u2014the largest effect size of any early grade reading program worldwide. These are results we can all be proud of,\u201d said USAID Mission Director Kimberly Rosen at the event co-hosted by the Ministry of Education.<\/p>\n<p>The collaboration between USAID and the Ministry of Education through the Learning Activity is one of the key partnerships between Ghana and the United States. The activity provided over 15 million high-quality teaching and learning reading materials, including teacher guides, pupil books, supplementary readers, and classroom materials \u2013 including braille materials for children with low or no vision. All of the materials produced by the partnership between USAID and the Ministry are aligned to the new curriculum and have been adopted nationwide for use in all public schools.<\/p>\n<p>At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic when schools were closed, USAID partnered with the MOE, the Ghana Education Service, and the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation to launch the National Reading Radio Program, providing access to literacy programs for over 1.6 million learners. In January 2022, after a year of the radio lessons airing, 57 percent of children improved their English reading scores, helping to prevent learning loss during the pandemic.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;color: black\">###<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><i><span style=\"font-size: 2.5pt;font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;color: black\">\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/b><b><i><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;color: black\">About USAID<br \/>\n<\/span><\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;color: black\">The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is the lead U.S. Government agency that works to end extreme global poverty and enable resilient, democratic societies to realize their potential.
