I know that Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs Marie Royce was with you for the opening on Wednesday. \u00a0I am excited to feel the energy in this room as you wrap up what I hope has been a productive seminar to strengthen business and trade for women entrepreneurs in Africa.<\/p>\n<p>My special thanks to the State Department\u2019s Office of Alumni Affairs, which regularly organizes these Alumni TIES seminars worldwide in partnership with the NGO \u201cWorld Learning.\u201d\u00a0 We are glad you chose Ghana to host this particular TIES seminar, and I am pleased to lead the U.S. Embassy\u2019s efforts to strengthen women\u2019s entrepreneurship on several fronts.\u00a0In addition to hosting this seminar, we just launched the Academy of Women Entrepreneurs (or AWE) this week in Ghana. I know you saw the AWE video during Assistant Secretary Royce\u2019s keynote address.<\/p>\n<p>The Embassy also collaborates with an active network of entrepreneurs through the African Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship Program, known as AWEP, and a dynamic group of women corporate and business leaders though the Fortune Women\u2019s Mentoring Program.\u00a0 And, there are many women entrepreneurs and business leaders who are alumnae of programs such as the YALI Mandela Washington fellowship, the <a href=\"http:\/\/yali.state.gov\">YALI<\/a> Regional Leadership Center, and YALI Tech Camps. If you are here today as a participant, it\u2019s because you are a leader with a proven track record.<\/p>\n<p>You are all exceptional Alumni, and you stood out enough to be selected to attend this seminar.\u00a0We are proud of our vibrant network of women leaders and entrepreneurs here in Ghana, some of whom are participating in this seminar.\u00a0 Ghana is rightly seen as a regional leader for peace and stability.\u00a0There is no doubt that this is due in part to the positive influence of strong women leaders and business owners, both in the formal and informal sectors.<\/p>\n<p>As the saying goes: to whom much is given, much is expected. I urge and encourage the Ghanaians here today to extend a hand and reach out to your Alumni network and contacts from other countries who look to Ghana as a model.\u00a0For those from other countries at this seminar, I also urge you to expand your network and seek out those who can benefit from your knowledge and experiences, the way that you are benefiting from this seminar.<\/p>\n<p>For each one of you fortunate enough to be here, there are millions of women in your home countries who need support, who need mentorship, and who need a network of others who believe in them.\u00a0 You can be this support for many other women.\u00a0 And for our male participants, yes, we have a few here!\u00a0 Your sisters, wives, mothers, daughters, and friends need you, too, in order to succeed!\u00a0Know that when we organize seminars such as this one that focuses on women entrepreneurs, we are not seeking for women to be treated better than men, but rather to be treated as equals, with the same rights and opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>We at the Embassy are fortunate to be in the position to offer women entrepreneurs support, whether through exchange programs, seminars, networking opportunities, or small grant funds.\u00a0 And we find that you, the participants, pay this back 10-fold or 100-fold when you go back to your communities and empower others.\u00a0 Keep doing what you\u2019re doing!<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ll close by saying that as an American, I incredibly proud of the spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship that has powered the U.S. economy and paved the way for prosperity and stability to flourish.\u00a0 That said, American entrepreneurship has been male-dominated for most of our history, before and after the equal-rights movement of the 1960s.\u00a0 Those of you here today and those whom you will empower have an opportunity to change the narrative for this continent to a story of powerful women entrepreneurs and captains of industry who become the driving force for peace and prosperity throughout Africa.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you all very much.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Alumni Thematic International Exchange Seminar (TIES): \u201cStrengthening Business and Trade for Women Entrepreneurs in Africa\u201d Ambassador Stephanie S.
