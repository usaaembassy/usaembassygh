The agenda featured panel discussions on finance and business support for women-led agribusinesses, as well as business-to-business sessions. The event culminated with an awards ceremony honoring women-led agribusinesses and smallholder actors for their contribution to Ghana\u2019s agriculture sector.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt USAID, we believe agriculture is paramount in driving Ghana\u2019s sustainable economic growth,\u201d remarked Sharon Cromer, USAID\/Ghana\u2019s Mission Director. \u201cOur Feed the Future Initiative works to equip individuals and communities by investing in gender-smart solutions. We are linking business service providers to women-led agribusinesses to increase their productivity and access to markets. Fostering broad-based inclusive economic growth means unlocking everyone\u2019s potential, including women, to fully utilize their talents.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This event was organized through Feed the Future and its partners, with support from USAID. Feed the Future works to increase access to finance for agribusinesses and smallholder farmers and improve agricultural productivity. To date, Feed the Future has unlocked $140 million in private capital for more than 2,400 agribusinesses in the maize, rice and soy value chains. These efforts have benefitted more than 150,000 smallholder farmers in Northern Ghana, 42 percent of whom are women.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">###<\/p>\n<p><i>About USAID<\/i><\/p>\n<p>USAID is the lead U.S. government agency that works to end extreme global poverty and enable resilient, democratic societies to realize their potential.
