The event featured panel discussions on opportunities within the industry; improving the competitiveness of local enterprises; and building strategic partnerships to ensure sustainable development.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cIncreasing the participation of small and medium businesses is crucial to enhancing Ghana\u2019s competitiveness in the oil and gas industry. This involves building the skills and expertise of local businesses to gain from opportunities within the sector,\u201d remarked USAID\/Ghana Mission Director Sharon L. Cromer. \u201cIncreasing local content can encourage the development of expertise and create more business opportunities. To drive future expansion, the private sector must take the lead and continue supporting the growth of local businesses to meet the needs of international oil companies.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">The event was organized by USAID\u2019s Supply Chain Development (SCD) Program. SCD works to enhance economic opportunities for local Ghanaian enterprises and business service providers. To date, the program has helped local businesses win 78 contracts with oil and gas companies worth more than $18 million. The objective of program is to improve the competitiveness of local businesses and create market linkages between local and international businesses in the oil and gas.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;text-align: center\">###<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><em>About USAID<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">USAID is the lead U.S. government agency that works to end extreme global poverty and enable resilient, democratic societies to realize their potential.
