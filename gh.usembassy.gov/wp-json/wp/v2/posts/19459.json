which must always be vibrant, independent, and responsible \u00a0\u2013 are constantly evaluating and reporting on the state of our justice systems.\u00a0 Access to justice, and the provision of justice, are fundamental human rights.<\/p>\n<p>As you have discussed in your exchanges, effective case management is intrinsic to the right to due process.\u00a0 We cannot over emphasize the role that the judiciary plays in promoting the stability and strength of a nation.\u00a0 The judiciary ensures accountability and transparency.<\/p>\n<p>Citizens and journalists rightfully expect that the courts implement justice equally under the law for all citizens, with transparency and accountability, without special privileges or concessions for the wealthy, powerful, or connected.\u00a0 Democracies are stronger when citizens trust the justice sector.\u00a0 In the same manner, democracy is eroded when citizens lose trust in this key institution.<\/p>\n<p>In democracies, strong justice sectors are a key safeguard against corruption.\u00a0 Fear of being held accountable is a strong deterrent to bad behavior.\u00a0 A strong judiciary also ensures that all international and domestic investors in Ghana play by fair rules.<\/p>\n<p>When we genuinely cherish our democracies, we start by nourishing and protecting our justice institutions, which are an important foundation for a future of peace and prosperity.\u00a0 A strong and independent judiciary can lead to greater trade and investment, and private sector growth that creates jobs for youth to confidently build their futures here at home.\u00a0 It is essential for all of us \u2013 and equally important, for the courts \u2013 to protect and defend the human rights of all citizens across this nation without exception.<\/p>\n<p>There is a Ghanaian proverb which says: <em>\u201cThe responsibility of power is like holding an egg.\u00a0 Grasp it too tightly and it will drip through your fingers; hold it too loosely and it will drop and break.\u201d\u00a0 <\/em>So it is with your stewardship in nurturing the power of the justice sector.\u00a0 Justice becomes frail if we become complacent in its protection.\u00a0 That is why this training is so important.<\/p>\n<p>Your presence here tonight, and professional exchanges this week, underscore our shared beliefs in core values.\u00a0 I close by saying that as we recently celebrated Black History last month and now as we celebrate Women\u2019s History Month, we honor the extraordinary lifetime achievements of Judge Williams and our distinguished visiting judges.\u00a0 They represent the promise of the American dream, just as each of you and your children represent the promise of the Ghanaian dream.<\/p>\n<p>I pledge that you can count on the United States of America as a partner in your journey to strengthen Ghana\u2019s justice sector, as we learn together and from one another.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>You can find photos from the reception on our <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/facebook.com\/USEmbassyGhana\">Facebook <\/a><\/strong>and\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/usembghana\/albums\">Flickr<\/a><\/strong> pages.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On March 12, Ambassador Stephanie Sullivan hosted a reception for former U.S. federal Judge Ann Claire Williams, accompanied by U.S. federal judge Margo Brodie, Minnesota Judge Susan Burke, and former U.S. federal Judge Donald Graham, and Ghana\u2019s judiciary.\u00a0 The Ambassador took the opportunity to praise the continued relationship between the countries and highlighted the importance &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1058,"featured_media":19457,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_gpalab_slo_mission_select":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[4,37],"tags":[7136,7334,7332],"class_list":["post-19459","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-ambassador","category-news","tag-ambassador-sullivan","tag-federal-judge","tag-ghana-judiciary"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Amb.
