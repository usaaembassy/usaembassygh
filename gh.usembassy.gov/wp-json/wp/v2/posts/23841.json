The Ambassador joined partners from Ghana, the Netherlands, and Zambia to support this first-of-its-kind project intended to address inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE) provided for women peacekeepers and increase their ability to meaningfully participate in peacekeeping missions.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne major barrier for entry? The \u2018unisex\u2019 personal protective equipment that simply doesn\u2019t fit women peacekeepers,\u201d said Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield. \u201cThat is why we are thrilled to commit $3 million to a joint partnership with the Netherlands to help Ghana and Zambia pilot women-specific body armor in peacekeeping.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_23844\" aria-labelledby=\"figcaption_attachment_23844\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 760px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-23844 size-large\" title=\"Women's body armor\" src=\"https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/LTG-body-armor2-750x462.jpg\" alt=\"Partners at the signing ceremony\" width=\"750\" height=\"462\" \/><figcaption id=\"figcaption_attachment_23844\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Representatives of the Governments of Ghana, Zambia, the United States, and the Netherlands at the signing ceremony for a new agreement to provide gender-specific body armor for female peacekeepers (December 5, 2023)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Women-specific body armor features a tailored cut, rounded chest, shortened torso, and adjustable back that tightens to fit, allowing the vest to conform to a woman\u2019s torso, providing better coverage of vital organs.

This project aims to reduce barriers to women\u2019s full, equal, and meaningful participation in UN peace operations.<\/p>\n<p>During the pledging ceremony, the Ambassador noted that \u201cwomen peacekeepers are more approachable to women and girls \u2013 especially survivors of gender-based violence\u2026they offer valuable perspectives on conflict, reconciliation, and peacebuilding\u2026and they serve as powerful role models for the next generation of peacekeepers \u2013 inspiring women and girls to imagine a future after conflicts end.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield said that an investment in this armor is an investment in women and the communities they serve.
