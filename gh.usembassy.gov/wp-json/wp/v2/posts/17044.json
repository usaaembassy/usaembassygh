so I promise not to keep your attention too long.<\/p>\n<p>As you\u2019ve walked around this evening, you have noticed the theme we have chosen for this year\u2019s event: \u201cGhana and the United States: A Partnership for Growth and Prosperity.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There are a couple reasons we have chosen to focus on business and trade this year. \u00a0Let me start with the historical one:\u00a0 Business and trade have always played an important role in American history, all the way back to our beginning.\u00a0 Two hundred and forty years ago, economic and trade policies were key reasons why our colonies sought the independence we celebrate today. \u00a0Since that time, business and trade have been central to our development and to who we are. \u00a0As President Calvin Coolidge once said, \u201cThe chief business of the American people is business.\u201d \u00a0Today we honor that entrepreneurial spirit.<\/p>\n<p>We are also focusing on business and trade because of their importance to our relationship with Ghana. \u00a0You may have heard me say that my goal for the next three years is to double our bilateral trade. \u00a0Of course, I hope to see an increased number of American products and services <i>here<\/i>, but I also want to see Ghana transform its manufacturing sector and send an increased amount of \u201cMade in Ghana\u201d exports to the U.S. market.\u00a0 Promoting economic growth and investment in Ghana is a priority for our bilateral relationship.<\/p>\n<p>American companies symbolize a commitment to quality, service, corporate responsibility, and strong ethics.\u00a0 Today you can learn a little more about the U.S. companies that have established a presence here in Ghana.\u00a0 These companies are bringing their technical skills to Ghana and helping local partners grow their own capacity.\u00a0 As business has evolved over the generations, so has the philosophy about what a business should be and what it should do.\u00a0 A good business is about growing local economies and improving lives.<\/p>\n<p>The companies represented today have implemented programs to increase farmers\u2019 productivity, improve school nutrition, provide clean water, and rescue victims of child labor.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re working closely with the government of Ghana to create an environment that will attract even more investment and stimulate the broad-based economic growth that benefits all Ghanaians, from you here in Accra to the farmer all the way up in Upper West Region.<\/p>\n<p>We recognize there are challenges in making that happen.\u00a0 There are limitations in infrastructure, power, and access to credit. \u00a0We\u2019re partnering with the government to overcome those barriers.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re celebrating our independence here today, and I anticipate that in a matter of months, we will celebrate together again, as we each exercise our right to vote in our national elections. \u00a0While rhetoric can oftentimes become harsh and divisive during the heat of an election campaign, I am optimistic that inclusion across lines of faith, gender, and ethnicity remains a central value of the United States. \u00a0And regardless of who wins, you can be assured of our commitment to Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>Here in Ghana, our only interest is in seeing a free, fair, <b>peaceful <\/b>election that represents the will of the Ghanaian people.\u00a0 The government of the United States does not support a particular candidate.\u00a0 We do not support a particular party.\u00a0 We will work with the elected government of Ghana, just as we always have.<\/p>\n<p>To our Ghanaian guests and colleagues, it is <i>your<\/i> vote that matters.\u00a0 I encourage you to educate yourselves on the issues and <i>demand<\/i> that candidates talk about the issues \u2013 creating jobs; abolishing modern-day slavery; fighting corruption; promoting decentralization; providing quality education, healthcare, and infrastructure.\u00a0 It is up to you to vote for your Ghana.\u00a0 On election day, some will win, and some will lose.\u00a0 Regardless of how your candidate or your party fares, we all win when <b>peace<\/b> and transparency prevail.<\/p>\n<p>Again, we all have a responsibility in this regard.\u00a0 As has often been said, the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men\u2014good people\u2014should do nothing.\u00a0 In the coming months, people who put their own interests ahead of all else will try to divide you.\u00a0 Stand firm.\u00a0 Make it clear that you stand for peace.\u00a0 That you stand for transparency.\u00a0 That you stand for Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>Before closing, I want to thank my many colleagues here at the Mission who worked very hard to make this event a success.<\/p>\n<p>I also want to thank our generous sponsors.\u00a0 More than 30 American companies, American franchises, and distributors of American products contributed to make this event happen tonight.\u00a0 There are too many to single out by name, but we have highlighted each one on the backdrop behind me, at the displays by the photo booth area, and on the simulcast TV monitor in the back.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a moment and express our appreciation for each of them by extending a warm round of applause.\u00a0 We are grateful for the strong relationship we share with our American business community.\u00a0 The American and Ghanaian private sectors are driving forces that strengthen our bilateral relationship.<\/p>\n<p>We cherish the relationship we have with Ghana.\u00a0 We cherish our partnership, and the growth and prosperity we are achieving together.\u00a0 Thank you for joining us today to celebrate our independence.<\/p>\n<p>Now, please join me in a toast: \u00a0To the good health and long life of His Excellency President John Dramani Mahama and to peace and prosperity for both our countries.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Honorable Minister of Employment and Labor Relations, Honorable Ministers and Deputy Ministers of State, Your Excellencies, Members of the Diplomatic Corps, Traditional and Religious Leaders, Members of the Press, And all our other distinguished guests, Mema moadwo and akwaaba. \u00a0Babs, Melinda and I, as well as all of our colleagues, warmly welcome you to our &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1058,"featured_media":17042,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_gpalab_slo_mission_select":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[4,37,54],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-17044","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-ambassador","category-news","category-speeches"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Independence Day Celebration | U.S. Embassy Ghana<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"U.S. Embassy Celebrates 240th Independence Day of the United States of America themed Ghana and the United States: A Partnership for Growth and Prosperity.\" \/>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/independence-day-celebration\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Independence Day Celebration Remarks by Ambassador Robert P.
