Even if the world seems to be mostly past the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 and we hope it stays that way \u2013 there are all kinds of other challenges in front of us, like climate change, and the threats to democracy that have arisen, both in West Africa and elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>But another challenge is that of internal conflict. The world\u2019s headlines tend to be dominated these days by the battles in Ukraine and Gaza.\u00a0 But you all know, much better than I do, that conflict closer to home presents a much bigger problem for the lives of many Ghanaians, as well as others in neighboring countries.\u00a0 This whole training program exists in recognition of that fact, and is designed to help you, as journalists, play an important role in seeking to address those conflicts.<\/p>\n<p>There are, of course, different kinds of conflict. Chieftancy, land, and ethnic disputes have existed in various regions for different lengths of time, and some of those causes often overlap.\u00a0 There is also the potential for violence by extremist organizations, though Ghana has fortunately avoided suffering any such attacks thus far, even as some of your neighbors already have.\u00a0 Violent extremist organizations will take advantage of any opportunity to sow doubt, division, and disagreement.\u00a0 Doubts and division begin when people lose faith in their government, their institutions, and their communities.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately we hope that the training offered helps equip you to take action in helping to defuse conflict, whatever the immediate cause or causes.<\/p>\n<p>This program is part of the U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability, which is a long-term U.S. initiative to prevent violence and advance stability in areas vulnerable to conflict. This initiative is not limited to Ghana; we are also undertaking it in four of Ghana\u2019s neighbors in the Coastal West Africa sub-region, as well as in a number of other countries around the world.<\/p>\n<p>Our approach brings to bear the diplomatic, development, and security tools of the U.S. government in collaboration with our partners for\u00a0a more peaceful and prosperous region.\u00a0\u00a0Our plans reflect our belief that effective prevention requires investments in the economic, social, and political health of historically marginalized and underserved communities. We know that violent extremist organizations thrive where public services, security, civil society, and governance are most challenged.<\/p>\n<p>Security concerns, like these, cannot be fully addressed through force alone.\u00a0 If we want lasting solutions, tackling the root causes of conflict is critical.\u00a0 That includes fact-based, ethical, and conflict-sensitive reporting like you will learn about over the next two days.<\/p>\n<p>Our partnership with the Media Foundation for West Africa includes training 100 journalists like yourselves from across the six regions mostly in northern Ghana, and also here in Accra.<br \/>\nWe are making this investment because we understand that journalists, just like public servants, security forces, community leaders, and civil society organizations, have a role to play in peacebuilding.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not just about improving reporting on community issues. It\u2019s also about using fact-based reporting to combat misinformation and disinformation.\u00a0 Before the recent coups in the region, many analysts saw an uptick in disinformation in those countries that undermined democratically elected governments.\u00a0 Violent extremists use the same tactics to undermine faith in security forces and recruit new members with false promises.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s where you come in. In an environment with increasing disinformation, you can be the reasoned, fact-based voice.\u00a0 You have the power to help communities better understand local conflict and perhaps empower those communities to de-escalate and resolve conflict themselves.\u00a0 You can empower local voices who preach peace, calm, and reconciliation over violence and vengeance.<\/p>\n<p>It is your role to help your listeners and readers understand the drivers of conflict. It is <strong>NOT<\/strong> your role or your responsibility to invite every side of a conflict to come on your radio show and attack their opponents.\u00a0 That\u2019s not journalism.\u00a0 That\u2019s sensationalism.\u00a0 And it\u2019s our collective responsibility to fight the urge to report on emotional arguments and indulge longstanding biases and stereotypes.<\/p>\n<p>This is just one of the projects under the Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability. As part of the plan, we are also engaging broadly in communities in the North to support peacebuilding and conflict resolution, like community meetings that include farmers and herders to discuss their concerns and develop shared solutions.\u00a0 Like community dialogues that open the conversation to include younger voices, who may be frustrated with progress or the lack of equitable economic opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>We are also helping build capacity among the security forces to engage in dialogues with at-risk communities. Soon, we\u2019ll also be rolling out a training program for young people across Ghana, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Guinea, Togo, and Benin, so that more young developing leaders can support peacebuilding in their own communities.<\/p>\n<p>Our priority is to support Ghanaians, Ghanaian institutions, and civil society to increase capacity for peacebuilding and conflict resolution, while building resiliency among vulnerable communities.<\/p>\n<p>You are an important part of this effort. We are excited to see how you implement what you learn this week to support peace and conflict resolution in your own communities and among your listeners and readers.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Remarks by Charge d\u2019Affaires Rolf Olson Journalist Training with Media Foundation for West Africa &#8211; SPCPS Tuesday, February 20, 2024, 10:00am Accra As Prepared &nbsp; Sulemana Braimah, Executive Director of the Media Foundation for West Africa Professor Kwame Karikari, our trainer today and founder of MFWA George Amoh, Executive Secretary of the National Peace Council &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1058,"featured_media":23981,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_gpalab_slo_mission_select":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[4046,54],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-23978","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-charge-daffaires","category-speeches"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) -
