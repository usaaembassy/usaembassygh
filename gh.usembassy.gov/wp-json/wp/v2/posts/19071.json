The concession arrangement ratified by Parliament is only the second such concession in the region in addition to Uganda, and by far more substantial.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>MCC often likes to say that challenge is their middle name &#8211; and there is no underestimating that on this Compact. \u00a0We commend the leadership of the Vice President, MiDA&#8217;s Board members and staff, the dedicated staff at ECG, the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission, the Energy Commission, the Ministries of Finance and Energy, and everyone whose efforts ensured this successful outcome.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This morning, while visiting Jubilee house, I had the distinct honor to present to His Excellency, Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia, the news of the Government of Ghana&#8217;s compliance with conditions laid out in the Compact related to the concession, new tariff plan, and payment of government arrears to ECG.\u00a0 The work of each of you has opened the door to an additional $190 million of grant funding from the United States of America to the Republic of Ghana.\u00a0 This complements the previous $308 million already accessible to Ghana, and a total of $498.2 million which MCC granted to Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This is extremely significant, and underscores our strong confidence in Ghana\u2019s bright future.\u00a0 Yet while we celebrate this milestone, we also recognize the need to further strengthen our endeavors to reach the goals of this Compact.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>First and foremost, we recognize that the concession is not yet complete.\u00a0 Full transfer must be completed between ECG and PDS.\u00a0 If Ghana is to reduce the current estimated distribution losses of $8 million per week, we need to tap into the private know-how and investment capital that PDS will bring.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Think about that figure &#8211; $8 million a week lost which could be invested elsewhere in Ghana\u2019s development.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We also urge MiDA, ECG, NEDCo, and MCC to continue their serious cooperation.\u00a0 Combining MCC&#8217;s grant funding and the capital expenditure program of PDS, there will be an injection of investment in the local power distribution network like never before.\u00a0 This $1 billion jolt to the local economy over the next five years will have a profound impact on the local labor market and the Ghanaian economy in general.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>My friends, we believe that promising times for Ghana are on the horizon.\u00a0 The United States is proud to be your partner in strengthening the foundations for increased operational efficiency, improved financial health, and creating an investment climate with stable power and reliable energy that Ghanaian customers need and deserve.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Congratulations on this milestone, and let\u2019s continue to build a bright future for all Ghanaians.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Remarks by Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires Christopher J.
