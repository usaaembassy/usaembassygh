Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade Gilbert Kaplan will head the delegation on stops in Ethiopia, Kenya and C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire as well as accompany Secretary Ross in Ghana. These visits provide an opportunity for the delegation to gather insight into market opportunities and challenges faced by U.S. businesses in these fast-growing economies. The PAC-DBIA will use this information to provide President Trump with reliable and actionable recommendations to deepen commercial relationships in these countries.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cPresident Trump and I firmly believe that American companies, working in conjunction with the African business community, will help African countries develop and, ultimately, take their rightful place within the international economic system,\u201d said Secretary Ross. \u201cU.S. companies can supply both cutting-edge technology and superior know-how regarding corporate governance and project management to emerging markets across Africa.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">This mission underscores the Trump administration\u2019s commitment to both advance opportunities and to eliminate trade barriers to strengthen the U.S.-Africa commercial relationship. During the trip, PAC-DBIA members will gather country-specific information for use in making recommendations to the President to resolve issues related to underdeveloped capital markets, non-transparent and price-based procurement processes, and workforce development.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">The delegation will be comprised of PAC-DBIA representatives from the following companies:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Acrow Bridge<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Amethyst Technologies<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">APR Energy<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bechtel<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Black Rhino<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Caterpillar<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Citi<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Computer Frontiers, Inc.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dow Chemical Company<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">DSC Dredge<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">GE<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">IBM<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Insta-Pro International<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Kosmos Energy<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Shea Yeleen<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Synnove Energy<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">UPS<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Varian Medical Systems<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Vermeer<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Visa, Inc.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Weber Shandwick<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">PAC-DBIA members have prioritized the four markets based on the potential to improve the U.S. trade relationship with each nation. The government of Ethiopia is making significant investments in infrastructure and is open to foreign investment. The government of Kenya is progressive in promoting business and actively seeks more U.S. companies in its power, aviation, healthcare, transportation, and agribusiness sectors. C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire\u2019s pro-business government seeks more U.S. companies in the country\u2019s transportation and energy sectors. Members selected Ghana due to the country\u2019s stable political environment and pro-market government focused on rail, road, mining, and manufacturing development.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Chaired by Secretary Ross, the PAC-DBIA advises the President on ways to strengthen commercial engagement between the United States and Africa.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>June 19, 2018 WASHINGTON \u2013 U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross announced today that he will lead a delegation from the President\u2019s Advisory Council on Doing Business in Africa (PAC-DBIA) on a fact-finding mission to Ghana later this month.
