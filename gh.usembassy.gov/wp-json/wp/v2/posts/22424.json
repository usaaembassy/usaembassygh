Women\u2019s Empowerment Lab!<\/p>\n<p>First let me thank Howard University for serving as our virtual host today and the International Trade Centre team for their contributions to this event.\u00a0 And of course, thanks to all of you for joining today.\u00a0 I\u2019m thrilled to take part in the launch of this dynamic effort, supported by the State Department\u2019s POWER initiative \u2013 particularly as we celebrate Women\u2019s History Month.\u00a0 Providing Opportunities for Women\u2019s Economic Rise, aptly known as the POWER initiative, promotes women\u2019s empowerment to advance economic prosperity.<\/p>\n<p>Through today\u2019s Women\u2019s Empowerment Lab, the U.S. Embassy in Ghana, in collaboration with the many partners from whom you will hear today, aim to do what we do best \u2013 foster connections.\u00a0We want to connect you to U.S. government and Government of Ghana programs and opportunities that will fuel your businesses in Ghana, in the United States, and throughout the continent.\u00a0 We want to connect you with additional opportunities to broaden your skillset.\u00a0And we want you to connect with each other to create a transatlantic network of businesswomen who will share challenges and best practices with one another, create new business partnerships, celebrate one another\u2019s successes, and support each other!<\/p>\n<p>As the economies of Ghana and the United States emerge from the effects of the pandemic, the opportunity is ripe for you to explore export opportunities.\u00a0The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), when fully implemented, will represent the world\u2019s largest free trade area.\u00a0 And Ghana, its businesswomen, and the U.S.-based diaspora community are poised to capitalize on the new economic synergies and opportunities that the AfCFTA can bring.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. government stands ready to assist both U.S. and Ghanaian companies to take advantage of transatlantic and intra-African trade opportunities through initiatives such as Prosper Africa, the West Africa Trade and Investment Hub, and AGOA, among others.\u00a0Today I am pleased to announce $4.2 million in new co-investments by the U.S. Agency for International Development\u2019s (USAID) West Africa Trade and Investment Hub to five companies operating in Ghana.\u00a0The grants are aimed at deepening the United States\u2019 commercial relationship with Africa, in line with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prosperafrica.gov\/\">Prosper Africa<\/a> Initiative and the <a href=\"https:\/\/ustr.gov\/issue-areas\/trade-development\/preference-programs\/african-growth-and-opportunity-act-agoa\">African Growth and Opportunity Act<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>By leveraging USAID\u2019s co-investments, these companies will generate over $45 million in private investment, increase exports by $166 million, and create more than 2,000 new jobs, mostly for women and youth.\u00a0The ripple effects are significant.\u00a0 Let me offer one example.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amaatigroup.com\/\">AMAATI Company Ltd<\/a> is a woman-owned, Ghanaian social enterprise that pioneered the revival of fonio, a nutritious African grain.\u00a0With USAID\/Ghana\u2019s $742,000 grant, and private investments of $4.5 million, AMAATI will work with 5,800 landless women farmers in northern Ghana and will help create a new West African global value chain for increased exports of fonio. \u00a0AMAATI will use American-made John Deere equipment and sell to Century Green and Mayaresa in the American market.\u00a0My team at the Embassy and I are deeply committed to, and involved in, building networks and skills through a variety of programming.<\/p>\n<p>In 2019, I was pleased to participate in the launch of the first of 10 African countries to pilot the Academy of Women Entrepreneurs (AWE).\u00a0 AWE is based on an online course called Dreambuilder that was developed by the Thunderbird School of Management in Arizona to bolster business skills.\u00a0 It includes a mentoring program through which participants are matched with other Ghanaian women entrepreneurs who are alumnae of our other exchange programs.<\/p>\n<p>I want to highlight the success of one AWE graduate. \u00a0Patience Owusu, owner of Peema Naturals, a shea butter, hair- and skin-care products company, started the company in her home, using a kitchen mixer.\u00a0 Thanks to AWE, she was eligible to compete for and win a grant from the U.S. African Development Foundation, ADF, with which she procured industrial-grade processing equipment, among other items, and funded production safety and quality control training for her new staff.<\/p>\n<p>The 2022 AWE cohort is expected to launch this month.\u00a0 Keep an eye on our website for your opportunity to apply.\u00a0We also actively recruit annually for the YALI Mandela Washington Fellowship, which focuses on strengthening civil society engagement, public management, and entrepreneurship. \u00a0We\u2019ve completed our intake cycle this year, but do be ready for the 2023 edition!\u00a0 When you participate in one of our programs, you will join the more than 3,000 exchange program alumni in Ghana, who are working in health care, education, the media, small businesses, government, and civil society organizations.\u00a0I\u2019ve repeatedly seen the power of women mentoring other women.\u00a0 Earlier this month, I participated in the Vital Voices Global Mentoring Walk here in Accra.\u00a0 It was inspirational to see the relationships that Mentoring Women Ghana has fostered between women.<\/p>\n<p>These relationships, like those we hope to create through today\u2019s program, will foster a network of connected, inspired, and empowered women ready to grow their businesses and help others along the way. \u00a0There\u2019s a proverb here in Ghana: \u201cIf you don\u2019t let your friend cross and reach her destination, you will also not cross and reach yours.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s help each other cross the road and reach our respective destinations together.\u00a0 I encourage you to seize this amazing opportunity before you today to learn, network, and foster connections.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Accra, Ghana \u2013\u00a0U.S.
