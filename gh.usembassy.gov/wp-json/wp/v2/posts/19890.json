I\u2019d like to offer a special thank you \u00a0to Ambassador Johanna Odonkor Svanikier, President of HACSA, for your energy and leadership in organizing this summit in this Year of Return, with the theme of: Legacy, Communities, and Innovation.<\/p>\n<p>The timing of this year\u2019s summit and exhibition entitled \u201c<strong>400 Years On: Marine Drive Heritage Salvage Exhibition<\/strong>\u201dis particularly poignant for me both personally as an American, and in my official capacity as the United States\u2019 Ambassador to Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>As you may have heard, last week we hosted the historic visit of U.S. Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, joined by 13 members of the Congressional Black Caucus, to mark 400 years since the first enslaved Africans arrived in Virginia in 1619. Speaker Pelosi called the trip to the slave dungeons \u201ctransformational,\u201d and I, despite having seen the Castles at least five times, was greatly moved to share the experience in the presence of the Speaker and so many iconic members of the Congressional Black Caucus.<\/p>\n<p>Representative Karen Bass, Chairwoman of both the Caucus and the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights and International Organizations, called the visit a \u201cprofoundly significant trip\u201d and added that Speaker Pelosi\u2019s presence \u201csays a great deal about the historical ties between our countries and reaffirms our commitment to Ghana and to the continent of Africa.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In keeping with that commitment, the U.S. Embassy is pleased to support HACSA\u2019s initiative that brings together a diverse group of people this week. This display of tangible artifacts of the transatlantic trade on the coast of Ghana here at the Kempinksi, as well as at the University of Ghana and Christiansburg Castle provides a springboard for initiating international dialogue.<\/p>\n<p>The HACSA Summit illustrates one way in which our countries are jointly building the future as we honor and remember the past, with all of its painful and joyful lessons combined, so that we reconnect and, together, march forward.<\/p>\n<p>The invitation that President Akufo-Addo has extended to African Americans and to African descendants throughout the diaspora for this \u201cYear of the Return\u201d embodies this spirit of reconnection and marching forward together. There\u2019s a Ghanaian proverb that says: \u201cWhen you remove one broomstick it breaks, but when you put them together they do not break.\u201d\u00a0 Meaning, there is strength in unity.<\/p>\n<p>We become stronger as we acknowledge and tell our shared story. For many African-Americans, that story involves finding their roots, through family lore and ancestral records where they exist, and more recently through DNA testing.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, two Members of Congress who visited last week had a special homecoming during their four-day visit. Through DNA testing, Representative Bobby Rush of Illinois traces his ancestral origins to the Ashanti, and Representative Barbara Lee of California, to the Fante.\u00a0 Such discoveries have led to many reunions of extended family members, separated even for centuries, and it is powerful to hear these reunification stories.<\/p>\n<p>Just this week I read the story of Congolese-born American Jean Kapenda, who through DNA testing found his fourth-cousin, Aiyana Lakes.\u00a0 Kapenda stated \u201cIt\u2019s as if I was lost and somebody found me,\u201d while Ms. Lakes said of being found and connected to her African family, \u201cOur history doesn&#8217;t begin and end with slavery\u2026Our first conversations had nothing to do with slavery. \u00a0It had everything to do with, \u2018Your tribe is full of strength in riches\u2026\u2019 \u00a0I wish that we as African Americans and scholars would teach more of the power that comes out of Africa versus just the slave trade, \u201d she added.<\/p>\n<p>This sentiment of capturing Africa\u2019s strength and richness is the aim of HACSA, highlighting and promoting the importance of heritage and culture for socioeconomic development. HACSA\u2019s Summit and this exhibition represent an opportunity not only to preserve our shared culture, but also to encourage and support civil society, including women and youth, to better advocate for conservation of heritage and culture. \u00a0This history belongs to all Ghanaians, all Africans, and all the diaspora communities worldwide.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ll close with some of the same words I offered two weeks ago to commemorate Emancipation Day in Ghana, \u201cMay this opportunity to reconnect during the Year of Return help get the real story out of today\u2019s Ghana and overcome misrepresentations and stereotypes. And may our longstanding ties grow from strength to strength.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Again, my heartfelt appreciation and gratitude to Ambassador Svanikier and HACSA for organizing an event that captures this sentiment and does indeed deepen the relationship not only between the United States and Ghana, but also between Africa and the diaspora.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ambassador Stephanie Sullivan\u2019s Remarks Exhibition Launch for the HACSA Summit 2019 The Heritage and Cultural Society of Africa (HACSA) Tuesday August 6, 2019, 4:00 p.m. &nbsp; Before I start my remarks, I would like us to observe a moment of silence \u00a0in memory of American author Toni Morrison, who today joined the ancestors.
