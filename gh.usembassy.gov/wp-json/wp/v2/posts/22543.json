You, as journalists, have a critically important role to play.\u00a0 Who else can help the public understand, discuss, and assess public policies?\u00a0 Who else can help the public hold government accountable for its policies?<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. government is a proud supporter of press freedom.\u00a0 GJA is just one example of the organizations we partner with to advocate for press freedom, protect journalists, recognize strong reporting, and develop journalism as a profession.<\/p>\n<p>GJA has been a leading voice in Ghana for responsible journalism, press freedom, and protection of journalists.\u00a0 I congratulate GJA for its steadfast commitment. There are many Ghanaian journalists working to fight corruption, hold the government accountable, and call out abuse and injustice.\u00a0 This often comes at great personal risk.<\/p>\n<p>We have seen multiple arrests of journalists in Ghana for their reporting.\u00a0 This is concerning for many reasons.\u00a0 Of course, the government has a role to play in protecting public safety.<\/p>\n<p>And at the same time, journalists need to have the space to report legitimately sourced stories without intimidation or harassment. \u00a0But media practitioners also have the responsibility to guard against misinformation and disinformation. \u00a0Better to publish late and accurately, than first and falsely.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s been more than three years since the murder of investigative journalist Ahmed Hussein-Suale.\u00a0 The case has not been solved.\u00a0 His murderers are free.<\/p>\n<p>Today, we honor his memory by advocating for justice and for protecting journalists from intimidation, abuse, and violence in pursuit of the truth. \u00a0In his honor, we also invest in quality journalism.<\/p>\n<p>Today we are pleased to announce our support for three new projects to promote stronger journalism here in Ghana:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, we will work with the Media Foundation for West Africa to support a fact checking fellowship for ten young journalists entering the field.<\/li>\n<li>Second, we will continue our collaboration with YALI TV to promote fair and equitable reporting on people with disabilities and the challenges they face.<\/li>\n<li>And finally, we will work with Dubawa Ghana to support fact checking training for journalists in rural communities.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These projects represent our continued support for responsible, inclusive, and professional journalism that protects and advances our democratic principles.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is an ardent defender of a free and responsible press.\u00a0And our support will not stop! \u00a0We look forward to deepening our collaborations with Ghana to support a safe, free, professional, and responsible media.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you to GJA.\u00a0 Congratulations on this event and for your support of press freedom.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Remarks Delivered by- Press Attach\u00e9 Kevin Brosnahan 2022 World Press Freedom Day Event Wednesday, May 4, 2022, 10:00 am International Press Centre, Accra, Ghana &nbsp; &nbsp; Good morning!
