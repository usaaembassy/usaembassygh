Berger, and reaffirm our appreciation to all Marines, past and present, for their service.\u00a0 We are awed by the bravery of the Marines throughout America\u2019s history.\u00a0 In my over thirty years of service as a U.S. diplomat, I have seen firsthand how Marine Security Guard detachments form an integral part of the communities of U.S. Embassies and Consulates around the world, including here in Accra.<\/p>\n<p>As Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said, \u201cThe Marine Corps and the Department of State share a long history and have forged one of the most important and enduring relationships that exists between two U.S. government entities.\u201d So what makes a Marine, and what motivates young men and women from our nation to join the Corps?\u00a0 For those of us who have not been Marines, let\u2019s imagine what their experience must be like on their first day of service. Imagine you are on a Greyhound bus.<\/p>\n<p>For our Ghanaian guests, that is an American version of the Intercity Bus.\u00a0 This bus ride is no ordinary journey, as the final destination is Marine Corps Recruit Depot in Parris Island, South Carolina or Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego.\u00a0 It sounds nice, right? \u2026 island living\u2026 a beach perhaps\u2026but I assure you, even if their minds are wandering, they know this is no holiday.\u00a0 The bus buzzes with young men and women from America\u2019s diverse regions and backgrounds \u2013 from the North, South, East, West, Pacific, Caribbean, and yes, \u2013 even permanent resident immigrants \u2013 they all volunteer to serve and defend the United States.<\/p>\n<p>All of them have different personality types: The high school star athletes, the gamers, the farm hands, the studious types, the social media socialites, the introverts, city slickers, and the attention-seeking boasters.\u00a0 They share a common exhilaration \u2013 and yes, some amount of fear \u2013 about the unknown they are about to experience, even though war movies have revealed much about Marine boot camp.\u00a0 They have seen films depicting the reveille calls at \u201czero dark hundred,\u201d the grueling exercises, the demanding drill instructors, the rigid mealtimes, and even the infamous cleaning of floors and restrooms with toothbrushes.<\/p>\n<p>Yet no one knows what the near future will be like, and some self-doubt must creep in about whether they have the stamina to endure what they imagine to be a tough and seemingly endless 13 weeks.\u00a0 There will be no vacations during that period, no weekends, no alcohol, no parties, no Mom and Dad, no dates with significant others, no rest except when they go to sleep, and even that will be rigidly instructed.<\/p>\n<p>Fear and maybe a bit of curiosity stimulates nervous conversation among the passengers.\u00a0 \u201cWhere are you from? Why did you join the Corps?\u201d\u00a0 As the bus nears its destination it grows unusually silent, until the only sound the recruits hear is the wheels coming to a stop in front of a line of drill instructors (or D.I.s) with their famous \u201cSmoky the Bear\u201d hats.\u00a0 Now the recruits can hear only their pounding hearts until a D.I. thunders into the bus to welcome them to boot camp.<\/p>\n<p>Many face some fear at that very moment.\u00a0 \u201cFear of what?\u201d you might ask.\u00a0 Fear of death?\u00a0 Perhaps, but then why join the service known as the \u201cFirst to Fight?\u201d\u00a0 The graves of our courageous Marines can be found around the globe, from Belgium and France to Libya, to Panama and the Philippines.\u00a0 For the last half-century, our brave Marines have all been volunteers who demonstrated their willingness to sacrifice by signing on the dotted line, and then giving nothing less than their all.<\/p>\n<p>Fear of failure?\u00a0 The fear of dropping out of basic training and disappointing oneself and loved ones causes anxiety in most recruits, although statistics tell us that nine out of ten will push through the crucible to become Marines.<\/p>\n<p>No, I suspect the unspoken worry for these untrained, untested recruits on our Greyhound bus is the fear of discipline.\u00a0 <u>Discipline<\/u>. For about two decades, give or take a few years, they have been showering when they feel like it, brushing their teeth when they feel like it, and making the bed (or not making the bed) when they feel like it.\u00a0 Maybe a parent held them accountable for their chores or their actions, and maybe not.\u00a0 They have been free to show their emotions and free to criticize others.<\/p>\n<p>All that is soon to change when the first Drill Instructor climbs aboard and shouts that they have 60 seconds to collect all their belongings and <em>GET OFF<\/em>!\u00a0 They might wish they could invoke <strong>sankofa <\/strong>at that moment. In fact, I actually got to experience a taste of these first steps in becoming a Marine as part of my War College experience in 2005, when we boarded a bus to Parris Island to see \u201cwhere they make Marines.\u201d The Drill Instructor indeed yelled at us as soon as we arrived, and continued to do so as we lined up on the famous yellow footprints.<\/p>\n<p>From that instant forward, Marine recruits learn how to do everything, big and small, with efficiency, purpose, and resolve.\u00a0 <u>Discipline<\/u>.\u00a0 \u00a0They learn to live and breathe the concepts, \u201cOne Team, One Mission,\u201d \u201cOne Wins, All Win,\u201d and \u201cLeave No One Behind.\u201d Discipline is defined as the ability to control oneself and others, even in difficult situations.\u00a0 What better way to describe the Marine ethos?\u00a0 Discipline determines the success or failure of our relationships.\u00a0 Strong marriages demand disciplined focus on each partner\u2019s emotional, spiritual, and social needs.\u00a0 Raising well-adjusted children requires a consistent parenting borne of discipline.\u00a0 Institutions derive their strength from disciplined adherence to established standards and norms.\u00a0 Bilateral relations flourish under a disciplined respect for the art of diplomacy advancing not only America\u2019s but our mutual interests to strengthen prosperity, security, and democracy.<\/p>\n<p>Discipline allows us to resist temptation.\u00a0 Temptation to allow our emotions to override our reason.\u00a0 Temptation to give in to group pressure, partisanship, nepotism, hubris or vengeance.\u00a0 Temptation to be complacent, to do just average work while expecting to be rewarded and applauded for giving minimal effort.<\/p>\n<p>It takes discipline to:<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; set a development goal and bring it to fruition.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; make a visa decision based on the law and not on our biases.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; keep our warehouse organized and our inventory up-to-date.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; document exemplary performance and give credit where it is due.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; be good stewards of every one of our taxpayer\u2019s dollars.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; organize an event like tonight\u2019s and get every detail just right.<\/p>\n<p>Bravo Marines!<\/p>\n<p>All these things also take love of country and patriotism,which the Marines have in abundance.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to take this opportunity tonight to commend our disciplined and patriotic detachment of Marines and their Detachment Commander, Staff Sergeant Kyle Martin, for their selfless dedication to our mission and service to America. We appreciate their vigilance at the nerve center we call \u201cPost One\u201d and that of the other men and women who staff \u201cPost One\u201d elsewhere as well, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.<\/p>\n<p>To all those in uniform here tonight, thank you for your service.\u00a0 In fact, will all active duty and veterans from all branches of the U.S. armed forces please rise to be recognized?Thank you for your service!\u00a0 Active duty members and veterans of Ghana\u2019s armed forces, please stand. Let us also recognize all of our employees of U.S. Mission Accra, Ghana \u2013 direct hire, locally employed staff, contractors, eligible family members, representing more than a dozen agencies. I would also like to recognize our Peace Corps Volunteers and Returned Peace Corps Volunteers for their commitment to the people of the United States and their country of service.<\/p>\n<p>For the Marines here tonight, and I\u2019ve learned there is no such thing as a \u201cformer\u201d Marine, on this 244th Anniversary of the Corps, know that whatever your future plans, you have been given a precious gift \u2013 you have mastered discipline, the key to untold success.\u00a0 As famed Drill Instructor R. Lee Ermey said, \u201cWithout discipline, there is no Marine Corps.\u201d\u00a0 Thankfully, at our Embassies, we have both.\u00a0 And we, America, and Ghana are better for it.<\/p>\n<p>May God always bless the Marines, and the United States of America. Happy birthday, Marines.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Semper Fi!<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Date:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10\/24\/19<\/p>\n<p>Approved by:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ambassador<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Drafted by:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RSO Jeffrey Rusinek<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Cleared by:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A\/DCM Hagen Maroney<\/p>\n<p>PAO Naomi Mattos (OK)<\/p>\n<p>PAO Roberto Quiroz\u00a0 (OK)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Remarks by Ambassador Stephanie S.
