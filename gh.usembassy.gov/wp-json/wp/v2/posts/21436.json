That exchange experience shaped the course of my professional journey.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you were on a three-week program about the rule of law, explored hip-hop for youth engagement, developed teaching pedagogy, were paired with a mentor from a Fortune 500 company, were on a 6-week fellowship, a multi-year PhD program, or lived with an American family while attending an American public high school, you all were selected for your demonstrated competence and leadership qualities.\u00a0 And you broadened the horizons of the Americans with whom you interacted. As alumni of the U.S. Embassy\u2019s civilian exchange programs, you are an impressive group.<\/p>\n<p>Numbering over 3,000 from 50 programs, you represent the U.S.-Ghana relationship across all 16 regions, hail from varied professional sectors, and include Ghana\u2019s full diversity. \u00a0Each of you has contributed to making Ghana great and strong.<\/p>\n<p>Ghana\u2019s alumni are 65% male, and 35% female.\u00a0 This lopsidedness reflects that in the early years, most participants were males.\u00a0 In fact, most of the people making the decisions about the participants were also males.<\/p>\n<p>As times changed and women\u2019s equality advanced, we included ever greater numbers of women in exchange programs, as well as in the selection process. Though we still have a ways to go, I have taken note of the overwhelming female presence among the executive board candidates!<\/p>\n<p>Our two oldest programs, IVLP (which includes the African Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship program \u2013 AWEP) and Fulbright, have generated just over half of all alumni from Ghana, with one-quarter from the Youth Exchange and Study (or YES) program, the YALI Mandela Washington Fellowship, and the Community College Initiative combined.\u00a0 Smaller programs such as the Fortune Women\u2019s Mentoring program, Teaching Excellence and Achievement, International Leaders in Education, and the Community Solutions program, have contributed the remaining quarter.<\/p>\n<p>So while there are big programs and small programs, no single program claims an outright majority of alumni, which is why having an inclusive national association is so important.<\/p>\n<p>Collectively, you are stronger than all your individual associations.\u00a0 Among our alumni, just under one-third come from Accra, with two thirds from outside of the capital.\u00a0 The Embassy makes a concerted effort to offer these opportunities to all qualified Ghanaians from throughout the country, recruiting for many programs on a regional rotating basis annually.<\/p>\n<p>The USGHAA is a microcosm of Ghana, like a mosaic, with all the individual pieces coming together to form a magnificent masterpiece that represents our shared ideals of democratic peace and progress, respect for human rights and rule of law, and inclusive economic prosperity.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to offer my hearty congratulations to those who stood for positions on the alumni association board.\u00a0 I admire your drive, ambition, and courage to give back and serve in a leadership position for an association that holds enormous potential for shaping Ghana\u2019s future, both in numbers and in influence.\u00a0 I know we are all looking forward to the announcement of the winning candidates at this ceremony today!<\/p>\n<p>Whoever emerges victorious for the executive board will need the support and collaboration of all the association\u2019s members.\u00a0 I\u2019m confident that we can count on alumni in your numbers to play a role to nurture this association.\u00a0 It will not be easy to lead a large national association comprised of different groups spread throughout Ghana; it will require determination, dedication, and a spirit of unity.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to build on the foundation for the association that was established a few years ago.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to recognize Nana Yaa Appiah for her dedicated service and leadership in the early days of the association.\u00a0 Nana Yaa \u2013 your focus on providing structure has given the association both an alumni database and a website.\u00a0 These valuable contributions have helped guide the process for taking the association to the next level.<\/p>\n<p>And we know that with your lessons learned and continued support and wisdom, the USGHAA will continue to grow from strength to strength. \u00a0\u00a0In recognition of your efforts, on behalf of the U.S. Embassy, we have a token of our appreciation \u2013 Nana Yaa, will you please approach the podium?<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m honored to present this award of appreciation to Nana Yaa Appiah. The citation reads, \u201cin recognition of service and exemplary leadership to the U.S. &#8211; Ghana Alumni Association.\u201d Medaase paa!<\/p>\n<p>With gratitude for past efforts to establish this national association, today we\u2019re marking a turning point and looking to the future of the USGHAA.\u00a0 The U.S. Embassy is committed to an even more active national association that joins all the various alumni groups under one banner.<\/p>\n<p>The Embassy will remain in a supporting role, but after today\u2019s announcement, we\u2019re entrusting the leadership to the new executive board.\u00a0 To the soon-to-be-announced executive board members, I urge you to take on this responsibility with integrity, honesty, and a strong work ethic.<\/p>\n<p>Your mandate is to set up the governing rules and regulations of the association over the next year.\u00a0 This will require collaboration, compromise, and decision-making to ensure the best outcome and the path forward for the USGHAA.\u00a0 You\u2019ll be asked to define a clear mission and vision for the association, to set achievable goals that promote the mission and vision, to establish a structure for leadership and committees, to communicate openly with your member stakeholders, and to uphold transparency and accountability.\u00a0 All of this will require time, dedication, and practice.\u00a0 We will support you, as a trusted Embassy partner.<\/p>\n<p>To alumni here today and joining us virtually from across Ghana, we welcome your participation and constructive contributions to the effort to rebuild, redesign, and renew <u>your<\/u> alumni association.<\/p>\n<p>I urge you to grant patience and grace to your newly elected board who face the task of uniting thousands of alumni from different regions and exchange programs under the banner of the USGHAA.\u00a0 As with any voluntary action, what you receive is directly correlated to what you pour in.\u00a0 Sometimes you will be called upon to step up and lead, other times you may be asked to demonstrate your leadership by following the decisions of others.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that even in times of disagreement, you have many more commonalities than differences; you have so much more that unites you than divides you.<\/p>\n<p>You are all Ghanaian, you are all seeking the best for your country, you all have skills and talents to bring forth as needed, and you are all U.S. alumni!<\/p>\n<p>On behalf of the entire U.S. Mission in Accra, we\u2019re proud of you &#8211; our Ghana exchange program alumni.\u00a0 We know that you are all amazing and doing great work in your respective professions and communities.\u00a0 We hope you will all join and support the USGHAA.<\/p>\n<p>As the African proverb goes, \u201cIf you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together.\u201d Let\u2019s go far together.\u00a0 Together we will rebuild, redesign, and renew the U.S.- Ghana Alumni Association!
