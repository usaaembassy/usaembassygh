I\u2019m pleased to join today\u2019s commissioning for the Dawia Community-based Health Planning Services (CHPS) compound\u2019s newly installed solar energy system. \u00a0This new system is designed to provide reliable and sustainable energy for rural health facilities and make quality healthcare services available to everyone. Through Power Africa, the U.S. Government remains a strategic partner with the Government of Ghana to advance Ghana\u2019s development and economic growth.<\/p>\n<p>The Power Africa Off-Grid Program is helping private energy services firms, like PEG Solar Ghana, connect with rural health posts to help finance clean, reliable solar energy. \u00a0Scaling up the use of renewable energy is necessary to improve the delivery of quality services, particularly in achieving Ghana\u2019s universal healthcare goals.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to recognize the innovative work that PEG Solar Ghana and Ghana Health Service (GHS) is doing to bring renewable energy to health centers.\u00a0 The GHS continues to be a great partner. We also look forward to the day when this technology can be installed in other health centers and facilities that provide other government services throughout Ghana, not only in the 55 rural healthcare facilities in the Ashanti Region participating in this pilot program.<\/p>\n<p>In communities like Dawia, stable energy can be a literal lifeline, allowing mothers to receive high-quality healthcare services 24\/7 and preserving the integrity of the cold chain for vaccine storage.\u00a0 It\u2019s expected that more than 7,300 Ghanaians will benefit from the extended services. \u00a0We wish PEG Solar Ghana and GHS all the best in their endeavor to harness the sun\u2019s light to bring energy to the doorstep of communities that the national grid has not reached, keeping people safe in the process.<\/p>\n<p>Today\u2019s event is coming at an auspicious time, as we celebrated Earth Day yesterday.\u00a0 It signifies a unique way to recognize <em>Asaase Yaa<\/em>\u00a0 whom we call Mother Earth, by deploying green energy to meet our needs and protect the environment.<\/p>\n<p>Earth Day reminds us not only of the generous bounty that <em>Asaase Yaa <\/em>provides but also of ways to honor and protect her for future generations. After all, w<strong>e have not inherited the earth from our fathers. We have borrowed it from our children<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>In conclusion, I commend the Government of Ghana through GHS and PEG Solar Ghana for their partnership to provide and deliver clean energy and quality healthcare to Ghanaians through this initiative.\u00a0 PEG\u2019s mission is to improve the lives of millions of people in West Africa, and I believe this partnership truly embodies that goal.\u00a0 I\u2019m proud to say that the U.S. government is working hand-in-hand with private sector partners like PEG Solar Ghana and the Government of Ghana to support Ghana\u2019s sustainable development and advance the United States\u2019 goal to promote economic growth, energy security, and a healthy planet.<\/p>\n<p>Medaase.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ambassador Stephanie Sullivan\u2019s As Prepared Remarks at the PEG Ghana Limited Ribbon Cutting Ceremony at Dawia Community Health-based Planning Services in the Ashanti Region, Ghana Friday, April 23, 2021;
