Jackson, has presented his credentials to President John Mahama and officially taken up duties as ambassador.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking from the ceremony at Flagstaff House on February 3, Ambassador Jackson thanked President Mahama for the warm welcome to Ghana and highlighted the U.S.\/Ghanaian partnership in four key areas\u2014democracy, prosperity, security and health. Ambassador Jackson expressed the U.S. commitment to deepening that partnership further.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn looking at prosperity and economic growth, it\u2019s clear that addressing the energy issues through Power Africa and the Millennium Challenge Compact will take us a long way. In addition, I believe that our investments in agriculture and our partnership in education will also ensure that we can build opportunities for Ghanaian youth.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Speaking further, Ambassador Jackson underscored the U.S. collaboration with Ghana on armed forces training and on programs to address HIV\/AIDS, malaria, nutrition, food security, terrorism, and trafficking.<\/p>\n<p>Ambassador Jackson also noted the November elections in both Ghana and the United States.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a unique year for our democracies. In November, your country will vote. Twenty-four hours later, my country will go to the polls. And in both cases, I\u2019m confident that we will continue the tradition of peaceful, credible elections,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel that it\u2019s worth restating that the United States\u2019 interest is only in the credibility of the election. It\u2019s up to the people of Ghana to decide their future. We look forward to working with the Electoral Commission and civil society to assist in supporting those elections.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In closing, the ambassador recalled President Obama\u2019s themes from his 2008 visit.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe believe, as the president of the United States said, that our successes are mutually tied and our partnership is indispensable.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ambassador Jackson served as the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for African Affairs from 2013 to 2015.
