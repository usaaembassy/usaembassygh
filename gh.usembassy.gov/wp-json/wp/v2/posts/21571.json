Sullivan joined Vice President of Ghana H.E. Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia on May 6, 2021, to outdoor a new U.S. government food security strategy. The first activity is expected to attract $261 million in private sector financing to boost Ghanaian agribusiness. The Honorable Minister of Food and Agriculture Dr. Owusu Afriyie Akoto also attended the virtual launch along with representatives of financial, agricultural, government, and private sector stakeholders.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. Global Food Security Strategy for Ghana (GFSS) is a five-year, interagency effort that aims to increase agricultural productivity, improve nutrition, and raise household incomes for millions of Ghana\u2019s agricultural workers. Under the GFSS, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is committing $19 million to support the initial activity, known as Feed the Future Ghana \u201cMobilizing Finance in Agriculture\u201d (MFA). The MFA activity, which will run for four years, seeks to increase access to agricultural finance in select staple and commodity value chains such as maize, groundnuts, shea, soy, mango, cashew, and other high-value export commodities. The initiative will focus on facilitating transactions among buyers and sellers of the commodity crops and promoting exports.<\/p>\n<p>Ambassador Sullivan described this new program within the framework of the United States and Ghana\u2019s long-standing partnership to improve food security, increase trade and investment flows, and support resilient and inclusive economic growth.\u00a0 In her remarks, Ambassador Sullivan noted that, \u201cThe U.S. Government reaffirms its commitment to assist Ghanaians to achieve self-reliance by helping businesses reap higher revenues and by strengthening trade between Ghana and the United States. With the ability to access loans at lower affordable rates, micro, small, and medium agricultural enterprises, including women- and youth-owned businesses, will be able to grow their businesses, expand into new markets, create good jobs, and export their goods.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The MFA activity will mobilize investment for Ghana\u2019s agricultural sector to become an engine of sustainable growth, self-reliance, and shared prosperity.\u00a0 It will work to connect financial institutions, business advisory service providers, and agricultural enterprises, providing access to strategic partnerships, technical support, and smart incentives to help financing flow to where it is most needed and help more Ghanaians thrive.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>As Delivered Remarks for Virtual Launch of the U.S. Feed the Future Ghana <\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>\u201cMobilizing Finance in Agriculture\u201d Activity<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>U.S. Ambassador to Ghana Stephanie S.

With the ability to access loans at lower affordable rates, micro, small, and medium agricultural enterprises, including women- and youth-owned businesses, will be able to grow their businesses, expand into new markets, create good jobs, and export their goods.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I urge all agribusiness owners, banks, business advisory services providers, and farmers to take advantage of the support offered through the Mobilizing Finance in Agriculture activity.\u00a0 Feed the Future Ghana MFA can help you meet your own goals and aspirations while also contributing to Ghana\u2019s growth and the well-being of her people.<\/p>\n<p>As the Akan proverb states, <strong><em>\u201cWofro duapa a na ye pia wo\u201d<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>or \u201cif you climb a good tree, you get a push.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. government will help agribusinesses that are committed and ready to expand and enhance their operations in the new working environment.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to thank His Excellency Vice President Bawumia and the Honorable Minister Akoto for their continued partnership as together we launch this new strategy and activity.\u00a0 We look forward to walking alongside Ghana as it continues along its journey towards prosperity, sustainable growth, and self-reliance.<\/p>\n<p>Medaase.
