Jackson<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>December 5, 2017 | 2 p.m.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\u00a0 Special greetings to KNUST Vice Chancellor Obiri-Danso, Pro Vice Chancellor Ansah and other honored guests. I am thrilled to be asked to open the second location of Pinkberry in Ghana \u2014 right here in Kumasi.\u00a0 It has only been five months since I helped christen the first store in Accra with Finance Minister Ofori-Atta.\u00a0 That was a landmark occasion, as it was the first Pinkberry to open in Sub-Saharan Africa.\u00a0 The success of this new American franchise in Ghana has exceeded all expectations.<\/p>\n<p>When Pinkberry first opened in Hollywood, California, in 2005, it became an overnight success. \u00a0Celebrities like Oprah, Beyonc\u00e9, and Michelle Obama have all partaken of and praised the healthy, sweet treat of Pinkberry frozen yogurt.\u00a0 Even when more locations were added, lines formed outside the stores and it could easily take 20 minutes or more to order.\u00a0 Pinkberry\u2019s Accra store has had similar success.\u00a0 From the looks of the crowd today, it appears Kumasi might experience the same effect.\u00a0 If you spot any celebrities in line today \u2014 don\u2019t forget to take a selfie!<\/p>\n<p>In all seriousness, though, the opening of this location is special.\u00a0 The Ashanti Region has often been called the heartland of West Africa \u2014 but it is also where we find the roots of Peak Investment Capital, the company that had the vision to bring Pinkberry\u2019s frozen yogurt to Ghanaians.<\/p>\n<p>Over the past 60 years, the United States has worked together with Ghanaians to enrich our bilateral relationship and strengthen our economies. \u00a0The opening of this store encompasses that ideal perfectly: \u00a0an American franchise, fueled by American and Ghanaian investment, fully operated by Ghanaians, utilizing many of Ghana\u2019s own incredible natural resources \u2014 not just with fresh toppings, but with the dairy as well.<\/p>\n<p>I am not sure if you know this, but for more than two years, KNUST and Peak Investment Capital have been working together to improve the local milk supply through the school\u2019s Dairy Research Station.\u00a0 With assistance from United States and other international advisors, they were able to increase dairy output and bring locally produced yogurt up to international standards.<\/p>\n<p>The success we are celebrating today is proof that the commercial relationship between Ghana and the United States continues to strengthen and grow.\u00a0 American brands and franchises are rapidly expanding to new markets all over the world \u2014 fueling job growth at home and around the globe.\u00a0 As the gateway to Africa, Ghana plays a key role for U.S. companies developing their presence on the continent.\u00a0 Ghana\u2019s stability, sound legal environment and steady governance are a solid platform for American companies to build upon.\u00a0 Joining with a capable local partner, as Pinkberry has done with Peak Investment Capital, is a great way to get started here in Ghana and throughout Africa.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m proud that American franchises are playing an increasingly stronger role here in Ghana.\u00a0 Kentucky Fried Chicken, Hertz and Avis have been operating in Ghana for years.\u00a0 Since I arrived in Ghana in January 2016, I have witnessed other American franchises opening their doors to the Ghanaian market, including Pizza Hut, Steak Escape, and Counter Burger.\u00a0 More are on the way, with many planning to be in Kumasi soon.\u00a0 These investments play a key role in improving the local business climate here in Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>Successful concepts are able to tailor their goods or services to meet the needs of each market, and I am confident Pinkberry will continue do just that \u2014 not only serving the people of Ghana a delicious product, but creating employment opportunities for Ghanaians and helping stimulate economic growth and development.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you again for the opportunity to be part of your celebration this afternoon.\u00a0 And now, I believe we are ready to officially open the newest location of Pinkberry.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know about all of you, but I am eager to get some of their delicious frozen yogurt.\u00a0 Congratulations to Pinkberry and to the city of Kumasi.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At the opening of Pinkberry&#8217;s Frozen Yoghurt shop at the Kumasi city mall on December 5, 2017, Ambassador Jackson celebrated American-Ghanaian partnership that will not only serve the people of Ghana a delicious product, but create employment opportunities for Ghanaians and help stimulate economic growth and development.
