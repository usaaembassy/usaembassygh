Together, we are improving millions of lives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I would also like to thank Global Communities. \u00a0You have successfully developed and harnessed innovative solutions to the most pressing development challenges worldwide. \u00a0I am happy to partner with you in Ghana through USAID\u2019s WASH for Health Project. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Finally, I would like to thank Duraplast Ghana, a leading Ghanaian plastic producer, for producing this latrine. \u00a0You have recognized what too many fail to see \u2014 that making the world a better place is good for business. \u00a0It is my strong belief that when governments partner with nonprofit organizations and the private sector, we make a much larger impact than we could alone. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When people lack safe sanitation, they are forced to resort to relieving themselves in the open or using other unhygienic practices. \u00a0This can lead to contamination of food and water sources and the spread of disease.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The toll on communities is enormous. \u00a0WASH-related diseases like diarrhea, cholera, and typhoid lead to loss of productivity, loss of income, and loss of life. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These diseases are most threatening to children. \u00a0Every two minutes, somewhere in the world, a child dies due to a WASH-related disease. \u00a0Children worldwide lose more than 400 million school days each year because of WASH-related diseases. \u00a0Poor sanitation leads to the inability to absorb micronutrients, leading to stunting and malnutrition. \u00a0The bottom line is: \u00a0poor sanitation robs children of the chance to achieve their potential.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Moreover, poor sanitation exacerbates the spread of epidemics like Ebola \u2014 epidemics that threaten all of us. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Here in Ghana, just 15 percent of people have access to improved sanitation. \u00a0Eighty-five percent of Ghanaians use unsafe sanitation \u2014 and 100 percent are vulnerable to WASH-related diseases. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But the good news is, we CAN defeat this health hazard. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ghana is a priority country for USAID\u2019s sanitation programming. \u00a0In just over two years, our WASH for Health Project has improved sanitation for more than 50,000 Ghanaians.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We have made the greatest gains through partnerships such as this one. \u00a0We partner with the Ghanaian government; American businesses like Coca Cola; nonprofit organizations like Rotary International and Global Communities; and Ghanaian businesses like Duraplast to leverage more resources, skills, and ties to communities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It is very important to acknowledge the role of communities \u2014 improving sanitation is impossible without them. \u00a0At USAID, our approach is to educate communities on the importance of sanitation, and let them take the lead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I have visited some of these communities, and have been nothing short of inspired. \u00a0I have seen chiefs mobilizing their communities to take control of their health. \u00a0I have seen teachers making sure all children in their classes know what to do to stay healthy. \u00a0And I have seen families banding together to build \u2014 and maintain \u2014 latrines. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I know it is not easy. \u00a0Building latrines is difficult, time-consuming, and a tremendous expense for people in the deprived areas that need them most. \u00a0And <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">maintaining <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">these latrines is even more expensive and time consuming. The result? \u00a0Too many latrines gather dust, are overtaken by flies, and remain unused. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That is why I\u2019m so excited about the latrine we are launching today \u2014 known as the \u201cDigni-loo.\u201d \u00a0The Digni-loo is <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">one-fifth<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> of the cost of other latrines. \u00a0It takes mere minutes to install, is easy and free to maintain, and can last up to 20 years. \u00a0Perhaps most importantly, we have tested it in Ghanaian villages, and everyone from chiefs to farmers to people with disabilities say it makes going to the bathroom easier and safer. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But even groundbreaking hardware like the Digni-loo is not a solution on its own. \u00a0Sweeping, sustainable change in Ghana will require millions of individuals to change their behaviors. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That\u2019s why I\u2019m so excited to also be launching the WASH for Health Communication package. \u00a0This package contains everything from instruction manuals to games and radio dramas that educate people on the importance of behaviors such as<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">installing, using, and maintaining latrines; <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">handwashing with soap; and <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">treating water. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We will be working with health and extension workers, to enable them to use these tools and to educate communities on simple changes they can make that facilitate a long, prosperous life. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The esteemed Ghanaian diplomat Kofi Annan said, \u201cNo single measure would do more to reduce disease and save lives in the developing world than bringing safe water and adequate sanitation to all.\u201d \u00a0I agree wholeheartedly. \u00a0I look forward to working with all of you toward this goal. \u00a0I have full confidence that if we all continue to collaborate, embrace innovation, and engage communities, we can make this vision a reality. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Honorable Kofi Adda, Minister of Water and Sanitation Resources,; Honorable Mohammed Nii Adjei Sowah, Mayor of Accra, Mirielle Hitti, CEO of Duraplast Ghana Limited, Alberto Wilde, USAID WASH for Health Project Chief of Party, Ni ma, Na ma, Nananom, Traditional Chiefs and Elders, Other Government of Ghana officials, Colleagues, Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen Good morning. &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1058,"featured_media":17714,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_gpalab_slo_mission_select":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[37,54,4007],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-17711","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-news","category-speeches","category-usaid"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Remarks by Ambassador Robert P.
