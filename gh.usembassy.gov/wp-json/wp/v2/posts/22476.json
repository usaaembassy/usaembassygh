Indeed, we all stand on the shoulders of our ancestors.<\/p>\n<p>Just as I reaped the harvest of what Ambassador Rob Jackson sowed, I am confident that Ambassador Virginia Palmer will continue to water the seedlings we planted in my time, as well as plant new crops.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. Embassy will be in the very capable hands of my Deputy Nicole Chulick, soon to be Charge d\u2019Affaires ad interim.<\/p>\n<p>When I reflect on the past three-plus years, I\u2019m proud:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Of how we invested in people,<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>making a major difference in the lives of thousands of Ghanaians, in public health, literacy, clean water, agribusiness, and peace and security;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Of our substantial improvements<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>to Ghana\u2019s energy infrastructure, providing more reliable electricity to millions of Ghanaians;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Of having built stronger economic and commercial ties,<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>and helping bring American companies to Ghana, creating new jobs on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean; and<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Of our support for Ghana\u2019s COVID-19 response<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>with supplies, equipment such as ventilators and oxygen plants, training, and more than 9.6 million lifesaving vaccines.<\/p>\n<p>Our relationship has grown, just as Ghana\u2019s regional and global leadership continues to grow from strength to strength.\u00a0We worked side-by-side to promote regional peace and security, and supported Ghana\u2019s positive role in West Africa under your sterling leadership, Excellency, as ECOWAS Chair for the past two years.<\/p>\n<p>I look forward to seeing how the Strategy for Preventing Conflict and Promoting Stability that President Joe Biden announced just last week is implemented in Ghana, as one of the five coastal West African nations included in this ten-year regional program.<\/p>\n<p>Let me also voice the United States\u2019 deep appreciation for Ghana\u2019s leadership at the United Nations Security Council, and throughout the UN system,\u00a0 \u00a0defending the cause of freedom and of right.<\/p>\n<p>We have deepened both official and people-to-people ties, with reciprocal visits by U.S. and Ghanaian officials, including the White House meeting last September between your Excellency, President Akufo-Addo, and Vice President Kamala Harris, that I was privileged to attend.<\/p>\n<p>The Year of Return attracted many of my fellow Americans to connect with Ghana in person, notably Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and 13 Members of the Congressional Black Caucus, including the late, great Civil Rights icon, Representative John Lewis.<\/p>\n<p>On the less official front, we offered professional, educational, and cultural exchange programs to young Ghanaian leaders.\u00a0We empowered hundreds of women to flourish in Ghana\u2019s economy through entrepreneurship training and other professional development opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>We trust you will continue, Excellency, to steward the economy in the face of global challenges, through enhancing the enabling environment and continuing to improve the investment climate to bring more jobs.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m thankful for the support the Embassy has received from people throughout the length and breadth of this beautiful country, which has made our success possible, and which lays the foundation for our future successes.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m profoundly grateful to count you all among the many wonderful people my husband John and I have met, and among the old and new friends we have made here. This group includes you, Mr. President, whom I left as Attorney General in 2001, and later saw from afar become Foreign Minister and then President of the Republic.<\/p>\n<p>When we returned to Ghana in December 2018, our own Year of Return, it was truly a diplomatic sankofa, coming home to a country where we had enjoyed Ghana\u2019s legendary hospitality for four years, and had the honor to be accredited by your good self!<\/p>\n<p>I have come to cherish the wisdom conveyed through the many proverbs and symbols that offer guiding principles, reflect values, and highlight our common humanity.\u00a0 I\u2019m reminded of another adinkra symbol, <em>Nkosonkonson<\/em>, the chain link, which depicts how we are all connected.<\/p>\n<p>I know I will continue to feel that connection long after I depart Ghana\u2019s shores. John and I will hold Ghana in our hearts when we leave in a few days\u2019 time.\u00a0 Thank you again for conferring on me this State honor, which is emblematic of the effective and growing partnership between Ghana and the United States.<\/p>\n<p>May the United States and Ghana continue to prosper and deepen our partnership forevermore!<\/p>\n<p>And before I leave the podium, allow me to thank my husband John Sullivan, who has been with me throughout, as a pillar of support.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for this great honor, and for your kind attention.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ambassador Sullivan\u2019s Remarks at Conferment of State Honor Jubilee House, April 7, 2022 &nbsp;
