Cromer, to commemorate the occasion.<\/p>\n<p>USAID supports the Ministry of Gender, Children, and Social Protection in the development and implementation of a policy and regulatory framework to promote family-based care and prevent the separation of children from their families. \u00a0Through this support, the Ministry has developed National Standards for Residential Homes for Children; Standard Operating Procedures for Inspection of Residential Homes; Standard Operating Procedures for Case Management; and tools to establish and implement a formal foster care system. \u00a0USAID\u2019s support also enables the Ministry to identify and monitor the numerous informal and unregulated residential homes for children throughout the country.\u00a0 USAID\u2019s investments also advance the reintegration of children into their original homes or into an alternative family-based setting. \u00a0These interventions will help the Government of Ghana ensure that children grow up safely and healthy and reduce child trafficking, particularly in the cocoa and fishing industries.<\/p>\n<p>In her remarks, Ms. Cromer reiterated the United States of America\u2019s support to the Ghanaian social welfare system by stating, \u201cToday we solidify our commitment to offer every child the opportunity to grow up in a supportive and nurturing family environment. \u00a0It is not only a human right accorded to them by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, but it is also critical to their health and development.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>About USAID<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>USAID is the lead U.S. Government agency that works to end extreme global poverty and enable resilient, democratic societies to realize their potential.\u00a0 USAID&#8217;s activities and strategic partnerships promote Ghana&#8217;s journey to self-reliance and a &#8220;Ghana Beyond Aid.&#8221;
