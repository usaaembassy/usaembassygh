The workshop launched on Monday, February 15, 2016, at the M\u00f6venpick Hotel in Accra, Ghana, and will run through Friday, February 19. It brings together more than 150 representatives from the government, civil society, and the private sector of countries including Benin, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Ghana, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Togo and Uganda. Speakers include Robert P. Jackson, U.S. Ambassador to Ghana; Ariel Pablos-Mendez, USAID Assistant Administrator for Global Health; Honorable Alex Segbefia, Ghana Minister of Health; and experts from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Bank and the World Health Organization.<\/p>\n<p>The workshop, entitled <i>Africa Regional Peer-Learning Workshop on Country Approaches to Risk-Pooling for Attaining Universal Health Coverage<\/i>, is facilitating interaction and knowledge-sharing between attendees on the topic of healthcare. It aims to familiarize policymakers with lessons learned and best practices for achieving universal healthcare, with a focus on financial risk protection.<\/p>\n<p>At the workshop, officials from Ghana are sharing their experiences expanding and improving the quality of Ghanaian health care. Ghana\u2019s National Health Insurance Scheme, which covers an estimated 40 percent of the population, has been lauded by the global community for its ability to provide equitable access and financial coverage for basic health care services to the Ghanaian population. USAID supports the National Health Insurance Authority in its efforts to strengthen its management, roll out a new provider payment system, improve its monitoring systems, engage with public and private health care providers, and increase the quality and scope of care.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cChange is possible when we partner together and learn from each other. The U.S. government, through USAID, collaborates closely with the National Health Insurance Agency to support its financial sustainability, increase enrollment, and improve effective coverage of quality health services,\u201d said Ambassador Jackson.<\/p>\n<p>These activities further the goals of USAID\u2019s integrated Health, Population, and Nutrition Program, which works to improve the health and well-being of the population in Ghana. USAID partners with the government of Ghana to achieve these goals and build leadership, improve governance, and build capacity in the health sector.<\/p>\n<p><i><b>About USAID<\/b><\/i><\/p>\n<p>USAID is the lead U.S. government agency that works to end extreme global poverty and enable resilient, democratic societies to realize their potential.
