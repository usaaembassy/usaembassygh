On October 19, 2017, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) through the U.S. Government\u2019s Feed the Future Initiative, in collaboration with the Government of Ghana and Agri-House Foundation, organized the event to build business relationships around the upcoming 2017 maize, rice and soybean harvest. In attendance were Deputy Minister of Food and Agriculture Dr. Sagre Bambangi; Northern Regional Minister Honorable Salifu Saeed; and USAID\/Ghana Agriculture Team Leader Jenna Tajchman who emphasized the importance of expanding economic opportunities for smallholder farmers and unlocking the potential of Ghanaian agribusinesses. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Pre-Harvest event brought together over 1,000 agribusiness stakeholders across the country to network and learn about the latest technological advances in agriculture. Participants shared lessons learned and identified opportunities and challenges within the sector. The event featured business to business sessions as well as an exhibition, showcasing improved agricultural equipment, inputs and services. The event served as a platform to rally agribusiness stakeholders and the private sector to forge partnerships and make strategic investments to spur economic growth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ms. Tajchman shared that, \u201cIn Ghana, our Feed the Future program aims to expand economic opportunities and boost agricultural productivity. Over 85,000 individuals applied improved technologies and practices on over 72,600 hectares of land. The application of these improved technologies combined with training and marketing assistance\u00a0led to farmer beneficiaries selling produce valued at over $120 million following the 2016 growing season. Now is the time to sustain this momentum and continue making investments that ensure Ghana\u2019s progress, especially as Ghana advances the Beyond Aid Agenda.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Pre-Harvest Agribusiness event has been held annually since 2010, and was organized through Feed the Future, the U.S. government\u2019s global hunger and food security initiative. Over the years, the event has linked rural farmers to new market opportunities and gained the support of the private sector. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tamale, GHANA\u2014Recognized as the largest annual gathering of farmers, buyers, manufacturers, government officials, development partners and financial institutions, the Seventh Annual Pre-Harvest Agribusiness event draws private sector investment and encourages the sustainable growth of agribusinesses in Ghana.
