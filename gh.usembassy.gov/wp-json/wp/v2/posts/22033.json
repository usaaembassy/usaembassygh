I\u2019m honored to join you today as we open the Ghana Agribusiness Summit hosted by the USAID-supported Feed the Future Ghana Mobilizing Finance in Agriculture (MFA) Activity.<\/p>\n<p>In May, Ambassador Sullivan launched this initiative as the first of many efforts through our Global Food Security Strategy for Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>This summit brings together the key stakeholders to unlock more than a quarter-billion dollars of agricultural finance over the next three years. Small and large agricultural businesses are here in search of needed capital to purchase more seeds, buy new equipment, and hire new staff. Financial institutions are also here to find new customers and to learn how to profitably invest in the sector. Advisors are here to learn new ways about how they can best serve businesses and to seek out new clients. The development community is here to learn how best to coordinate their programming to empower the Ghanaian people. Government is here to provide support and guidance, and to listen to private sector needs in order to incorporate solutions into future policy. Media is here to spread the word far and wide. We all play an important role.<\/p>\n<p>But being here isn\u2019t enough.\u00a0 The challenges we face are real. The market for agricultural finance in Ghana remains nascent and undeveloped, representing a great opportunity for growth. Although some financial institutions remain reluctant to invest in agriculture, there are exciting opportunities to do so, whether in less developed crops such as cowpea and shea, or by increasing the engagement of women and youth. Business consultants lack the networks and specialist knowledge to effectively advise agribusinesses. And businesses need to build trust among each other to share knowledge about their practices and realize the value that business services, like accounting and long-term strategic planning, can offer. Over the next three days, this interactive summit will feature panels and discussions on topics designed to address these challenges head on. I encourage you to participate in all of them.<\/p>\n<p>The hard work has already begun. To give one example, through MFA, the United States Government linked a transaction advisor, Solutions Agribusiness, to Tumu Cooperative Credit Union to help 24 farmers receive a total of $560,000 in loans so they could buy fertilizer and seeds at a bulk discount. This is a real-world example of this initiative benefitting Ghanaians.<\/p>\n<p>In another example, MFA trained Bawku East Small Scale Farmers Association Rural Bank on how to accurately assess risk in the agriculture sector. The training also provided guidance on how to structure repayments in-terms of timing and size to minimize these risks. As a result, the Bank doubled its lending to farmers and agribusiness.<\/p>\n<p>As a third example, MFA helped John Dimah, a farmer, prepare the loan application and required documents needed to purchase a John Deere tractor. John used this tractor to help 3,500 smallholder farmers prepare land in Sissala West for the planting season. These farmers previously relied on cattle-driven plows and communal labor to cultivate their maize, soy, groundnut, and cowpea.<\/p>\n<p>These types of investments mean that Ghanaian tables will have more food, Ghanaian businesses will earn greater profits, and Ghanaian families will live healthier, more prosperous lives.<\/p>\n<p>There is a risk that the good work accomplished by Ghanaian agricultural professionals may be blunted by the continuing COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0 The USG continues to help the Government of Ghana to contain COVID-19 to help restore economic activity and strengthen social ties.\u00a0 We have already provided more than 2.5 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to the Government of Ghana and we have partnered with local firms to boost their production of face masks and hand sanitizer.\u00a0 I encourage you and your family members to follow the Ghana Health Services directives and get vaccinated.\u00a0 Vaccines are key to defeating the pandemic and restoring economic growth.<\/p>\n<p>We also know the climate crisis impacts all nations.\u00a0 In response to this crisis, the United States recently announced the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate, a pioneering effort by 31 countries including Ghana, to encourage climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation through private investment and public-private partnerships.\u00a0 The United States looks forward to working with Ghana to protect and secure our shared fragile ecosystems.<\/p>\n<p>While much has been done, there is much yet to do.\u00a0 Today, the U.S. Government reaffirms its commitment to help Ghanaians move from subsistence farming and low value addition to become a leader in Africa\u2019s agricultural development.\u00a0 A more developed Ghana is a stronger trade partner for the United States.<\/p>\n<p>I would like to thank Deputy Minister Michael Okyere Baafi for joining us here at this important summit.\u00a0 I urge all of the agribusiness owners, banks, consultants, and farmers to participate in the upcoming panels, business pitches, and networking.\u00a0 We look forward to continuing to walk alongside Ghana as it continues along its journey towards prosperity, sustainable growth, and self-reliance.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Accra, GHANA \u2013 The United States Government, through the U.S. Agency for International Development, and the Ghana Ministry of Industry will host the <a href=\"https:\/\/events.hubilo.com\/2021-ghana-agribusiness-investment-summit\/login\">Ghana Agribusiness Investment Summit November 16-18, 2021. <\/a> \u00a0The virtual summit, which opens today, will bring together over 400 stakeholders in the agribusiness sector, transaction advisors, financial institutions, and investors, along with representatives of the United States and Ghana governments, &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1058,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_gpalab_slo_mission_select":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[1163,37,44,54,61,64,4007],"tags":[4066],"class_list":["post-22033","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-agriculture","category-news","category-press-releases","category-speeches","category-us-and-gh","category-us-agencies","category-usaid","tag-press-release"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) -
