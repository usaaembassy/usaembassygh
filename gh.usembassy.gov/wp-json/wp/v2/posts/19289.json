The boat will provide life-saving services to historically hard-to-reach island communities.\u00a0 The pontoon boat will improve access to health care for 141 island communities in Kpando, Krachi West and Biakoye districts. \u00a0Health care workers will be able to deliver services to island communities and transfer patients to health facilities on the mainland when referrals are required. The boat will also deliver essential health commodities, support health-related immunization campaigns, and provide disaster relief on the islands.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_19288\" aria-labelledby=\"figcaption_attachment_19288\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 760px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-19288 size-large\" title=\"32514711288_863b66bbb9_o\" src=\"https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/32514711288_863b66bbb9_o-750x500.jpg\" alt=\"25-seater medical boat\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/32514711288_863b66bbb9_o-750x500.jpg 750w, https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/32514711288_863b66bbb9_o-350x233.jpg 350w, https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/32514711288_863b66bbb9_o-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/32514711288_863b66bbb9_o-200x133.jpg 200w, https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/32514711288_863b66bbb9_o.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" \/><figcaption id=\"figcaption_attachment_19288\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">25-seater medical boat<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In her remarks, USAID Ghana Mission Director Cromer urged community members to be active participants in health services, stating, \u201cUltimately, the success of CHPS is rooted in community ownership and self-reliance. \u00a0It is the responsibility of every citizen to be engaged in CHPS services. \u00a0This includes the upkeep of the boat and the maintenance of the CHPS compound where you access care.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Locally made with a secure structural design, GHS and USAID designed the boat to withstand the conditions of Lake Volta.
