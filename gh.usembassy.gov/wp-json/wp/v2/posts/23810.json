Your support for Ghana\u2019s private sector-led recovery as well as your concrete advice to the U.S. and Ghanaian Governments is more essential than ever to improving the business environment.<\/p>\n<p>We should all give thanks for is the service of the outgoing Chamber executives.\u00a0 Please let me salute President Ayesha Bedwei Ibe; Vice President Pakwo Shum; and the other board members who have been terrific partners. (Encourage applause)<\/p>\n<p>And congratulations to incoming President Kimathi Kuenyehia (KOON-yeh-ee-ah).\u00a0 We look forward to your leadership, Kimathi, and to working with you.<\/p>\n<p>One of our highlights this year was our cooperation with AmCham on the U.S. \u2013 Ghana Business Forum.\u00a0 Thank you for your tremendous efforts on that event.\u00a0 Attended by more than 800 people, the Forum projected the full spectrum of U.S. \u2013 Ghanaian economic and commercial engagement. \u00a0A new Budget Enterprise franchise was launched, and several new MOUs were signed as a result. \u00a0It also sent a key message that the United States remains Ghana\u2019s steadfast \u2013 and best &#8211; partner and \u2013 if steps are taken to improve the business environment \u2013 American business is <u>extremely <\/u>interested in trade and investment in Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>One of the key issues at the Forum was the role of the African diaspora and how to better leverage that force.\u00a0 Every day, I am reminded how critical the diaspora is to our partnership with Ghana.\u00a0 The deep, historical, relationships among our peoples are a crucial dimension of our bilateral relationship.<\/p>\n<p>And they are growing.\u00a0 For example, the number of Ghanaian students in the United States grew by over 30 percent last year, one of the highest increases of any country in the world, and Ghana is now the 14<sup>th<\/sup> largest sender of student to the U.S. worldwide.\u00a0 These students are forging new ties &#8212; business, academic, and personal &#8212; that will define the Ghanaian diaspora for the next generation.<\/p>\n<p>The head of Brookings\u2019 Africa Growth Initiative Dr. Landry Sign\u00e9 calls the Africa diaspora a \u201cmegatrend\u201d that will positively impact Africa &#8212; and I would argue &#8212; will positively impact Ghana, in particular.\u00a0 We know it well here in the business community.\u00a0 Mona Boyd, Joe Mensa, and others \u2013 you were leading the charge of this megatrend.<\/p>\n<p>The diaspora began in the horrors of the Transatlantic slave trade but evolved with Ghanaian students studying in the United States, including Kwame Nkrumah, who returned to lead Ghana to independence \u2013 that \u201cBlack Star Rising\u201d that meant so much not just for other African countries but for African Americans struggling for justice at home.<\/p>\n<p>Vice President Harris\u2019 historic visit highlighted the role of diaspora in creative and other industries in Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>Back at home, the White House created the President\u2019s Advisory Council on African Diaspora Engagement to recommend to President Biden how we can further leverage the diaspora\u2019s strong interest in furthering Africa\u2019s development, prosperity and security.<\/p>\n<p>The Council\u2019s 12 members, sworn in by Vice President Harris just last month, are representatives of the African American and African immigrant communities.\u00a0 They are distinguished individuals from government, sports, the creative industries, business, academia, and faith-based organizations.\u00a0 One of them, Director of the Smithsonian&#8217;s National Museum of African American History and Culture\u00a0 Kevin Young was here with Vice President Harris in March. \u00a0I think we should see if we can get the Council to come!<\/p>\n<p>Ghana has the African diaspora community\u2019s attention. As our Global Diversity trade mission to Ghana in August showed, the African diaspora is ready to do business in Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>However, macroeconomic stability and trade and investment policies matter to the diaspora \u2013 just as they do to all businesspeople. Diaspora investors know if others are not getting paid, if there is a lack of contract sanctity, or if there is overly aggressive tax collection.\u00a0 Treating existing investors well tangibly improves the investment climate.\u00a0 And unnecessary barriers to entry and partnerships \u2013 such as the high minimum threshold for investment \u2013 hinder it. \u00a0We have terrific Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises on both sides of the Atlantic that could be partnering and creating ventures. For Ghanaian companies facing high interest rates, an investment infusion of even $50,000 from a foreign partner could be transformative right now.<\/p>\n<p>But when we talk about lowering barriers to trade and investment, we also need to talk about treating people fairly and ensuring your employees are safe and protected from legalized discrimination.\u00a0 I want to broach a subject that I know is sensitive, but is more important in a business context than most people realize.<\/p>\n<p>Ghana\u2019s Parliament is considering a bill that would curtail the human rights of the LGBTQI+ community, their families, allies, and quite frankly all Ghanaians.\u00a0 \u00a0Everybody has opinions about the issue \u2013 and I respect that, even if I may disagree.\u00a0 But\u00a0 very few people have read the Bill.\u00a0 The reality is that the bill undermines basic free speech rights that Ghanaians otherwise enjoy. \u00a0The goal of the bill, which the drafters are not shy about advertising, is to make Ghana hostile not only to LGBTQI+ people, but to anyone who even sympathizes with them.\u00a0 It seeks to make illegal all discussion and all media that even mentions LGBTQI+ issues.\u00a0 If passed, this bill will make it harder for you to not only recruit and hire the best people from overseas, but it will also marginalize educated and hard-working Ghanaians by making it clear they are unwelcome.<\/p>\n<p>I have no doubt such legislation would have a chilling effect on Ghana as an investment destination. \u00a0The bill, in any form, will make it harder for me to sell Ghana as a place American investors and businesses should come.\u00a0 I have talked with American businesses who tell me they are concerned and re-thinking their investment and purchasing strategies in Ghana because of the threat of the bill.\u00a0 \u00a0You see then that the legislation \u2013 in addition to undermining public health and public order &#8211; would reduce forex inflow, cut into your bottom lines and reduce your workforce options, not something Ghana\u2019s suffering business environment needs.<\/p>\n<p>I am truly thankful to those of you who have raised these issues to Ghanaian policymakers.\u00a0 As representatives of the business community, and as the partners Ghana needs to build a truly inclusive 21<sup>st<\/sup> century economy, your voices need to be heard \u2013 and they need to be heard now, before irreparable damage is done.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">So to sum up, implementing simple, pro-business policies could accelerate the diaspora megatrend that we are all seeing &#8212; and some of you are embodying.\u00a0 But Ghana won\u2019t automatically benefit from this trend.\u00a0 Foreign companies moving here to invest and employ Ghanaians need to see trade, regulation, and legal frameworks that allow businesses to thrive, while protecting employees.<\/p>\n<p>It is my hope that our trade and commercial relationship will continue to benefit all Ghanaians. That\u2019s what we work every day to achieve.<\/p>\n<p>Before I close, please allow me to congratulate in advance tonight\u2019s honorees and award recipients.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s give thanks for the many blessings in our lives, both big and small, and remember that the heart of this holiday is the spirit of togetherness.\u00a0 I am very thankful for all of you!\u00a0 Happy Thanksgiving!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ambassador Palmer Speech AmCham Thanksgiving Dinner November 18, 2023 As prepared for delivery &nbsp; Good evening, everyone!
