And Ghana?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I\u2019m delighted to be here today at the Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI) Regional Leadership Center (RLC) to celebrate the success of the 15th cohort of YALI RLC graduates at this closing ceremony. When I hear about the impact that YALI alumni are making across this continent, I know that the program is an excellent investment in the Africa of today and tomorrow by the American people:\u00a0 an investment in supporting the ideas, aspirations, and efforts of African youth; an investment in African solutions to African challenges; and most of all, an investment in you!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And indeed, Africa has a bright future.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I\u2019d like to offer my appreciation to those who made today\u2019s program possible.\u00a0 Thank you to the members of the Accra RLC, and to the staff of GIMPA for organizing this ceremony, and for all the work they do supporting the YALI RLC program.\u00a0 Training more than 5,100 young leaders is an outstanding achievement. Congratulations!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I\u2019d also like to thank the RLC Governing Council, our YALI RLC partners, trainers, speakers, and support staff for their time dedication to the program\u2019s success.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To our gracious partners, thank you for your support.\u00a0 The United States is grateful for your generous contributions towards making the RLC and this program a reality.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To all the young men and women participants, we are grateful for your commitment to advancing the vision of the program and your determination to make a positive difference in the world.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Today, we\u2019re honored to have with us several guests from the private sector and many non-government organizations, who share our passion for investing in young African leaders. \u00a0 I want to thank you for attending this closing ceremony. We appreciate your unwavering support. YALI RLC Graduates, Congratulations on your successful participation in this wonderful opportunity. To cite an African saying that goes against the grain of the more commonly encountered attitude of \u201cwait your turn,\u201d \u201cWhen the youth beat the drums, the elders can also dance.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As U.S. Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of African Affairs Tibor Nagy stated at this year\u2019s Mandela Washington Fellows Summit, \u201cNow with your YALI experience, you bear a special responsibility to help build a better future for Africa, to empower people to be active members of their communities, and to be the force behind democracy, economic growth, and strong civil society. These responsibilities extend to serving as role models for the youth of your countries, sharing your experiences with them, and sharing your skills and expertise to create a ripple effect across the region.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I know there are many in this room who are already working to fulfill this great responsibility. Young people like Nacel Josephine Johnson, who not only travels around Freetown and surrounding cities to lead and contribute to discussions on inclusivity and equal rights for persons with disabilities in Sierra Leone, but she has also established a partnership between the organization she works with, OneFamilyPeople, and the Accra RLC to help the RLC directly reach, recruit, and train people with disabilities from each of the nine countries during Phase Two of the YALI RLC project.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Or Andrew Abuska, who owns and manages Eye of the Brain Ecofeeds, an ecological enterprise that produces Neat MagFeed Dried feed for poultry and fish in the Garu Tempane district of Ghana\u2019s Upper East Region.\u00a0 Andrew recycles organic waste that would have ordinarily been burnt and harmed the environment. He transforms this waste into organic fertilizer. I know that Andrew will employ the skills gained from the RLC program to advance his business while also creating a cleaner environment for future generations in Ghana. We\u2019ll be following your efforts and applauding your continued success.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As we celebrate all of you here today, I\u2019d like to reaffirm the commitment of the people and government of the United States to support future African leaders, like you, with dreams rooted in service above self.\u00a0 Let me repeat this important point: <\/span><b>service above self<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Each of you will play a key role in shaping the future of West Africa.\u00a0 You are here today because you decided to make a positive difference in the lives of others.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We place our hope in you to unite people across all levels of society to be positive builders of peace and development.\u00a0 It takes a special kind of leader to motivate others to identify and reach common solutions to extraordinary challenges. \u00a0 Let me remind you of our expectation that you will embody the spirit of the following saying: <\/span><b>\u201cIf your actions inspire others to dream more, to learn more, to do more and to become more, then you are a leader.\u201d<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Graduates, your experience as part of this prestigious residential program may have concluded, but I understand you still have some homework to do, and your work as soon-to-be YALI alumni is just beginning.\u00a0 You are now a part of a larger network, joining the ranks of the exceptional Mandela Washington Fellows and YALI Network alumni.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I challenge you to see yourselves as key contributors to your country, the continent of Africa, and the world.\u00a0 We all share one planet and one home. If Ghana and Africa prosper, then the United States and the world also prosper.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thanks for your kind attention, Thanks to our sign interpreter, and congratulations to you all once again!<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>YALI Regional Leadership Center (RLC) Accra 15th Cohort Training Closing Ceremony As Prepared Remarks by U.S. Ambassador to Ghana Stephanie S.
