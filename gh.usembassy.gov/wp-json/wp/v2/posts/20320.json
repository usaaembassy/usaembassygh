Let me say that all of you present here are very special! Today I want to speak with you about the importance, power, and need for women to mentor other women.\u00a0 This event is a great way to start off 2020, and it\u2019s not too late to make those New Year\u2019s Resolutions \u2013 including becoming a mentor if you can and seeking mentorship.\u00a0Or maybe even both \u2013 since mentoring and being mentored are not mutually exclusive, and we can make our best contributions by being lifelong learners.<\/p>\n<p>Women benefit greatly when leaders, especially women, take the time to mentor other women and set them on a path to greater success.\u00a0 I would not be here without having learned from my mentors, and it\u2019s likely each of you had a powerful mentor who encouraged you and helped shape you along the way. The world can never have enough women leaders, but there are enough of us now for us to encourage successful women to pay their success forward by mentoring more women.\u00a0 Do you agree?<\/p>\n<p>Throughout my career, I have relied on the advice and wisdom of my elders, peers, and friends, and I\u2019d like to think that I have also added value for others.\u00a0 This spirit of continuous improvement brings to mind one of my favorite African sayings: \u201cWe all stand on the shoulders of our ancestors.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In the spirit of providing those shoulders to help boost others, here are a five of my thoughts on mentoring:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>As you climb the ladder of success, remember to lift others up to succeed in their own journeys, because success has a ripple effect of inspiration beyond those whom you mentor.\u00a0 They too will pass on your lessons to others, so your legacy will live on. It feels good when my mentees tell me \u201cI found myself channeling Stephanie Sullivan today\u201d in a challenging situation, and when I hear the wise words of my own mentors inside my head, even those who have joined the ancestors.<\/li>\n<li>Most successful people will tell you that, along their journey, they succeeded sometimes, and also suffered setbacks. They rose and persevered, succeeded again, perhaps experienced more setbacks, but demonstrated resiliency, and then succeeded again.\u00a0 It is rarely a straight line to the top. There will be many stumbles and falls along the way, and it is at those points when mentorship is crucial in righting the path.\u00a0 It\u2019s important to be honest as a mentor \u2013 talk about your own setbacks and how they contributed to your growth as a person.\u00a0 \u00a0Once you are in a leadership position, others may find it hard to imagine that you also struggled and continue to struggle! By the way, you may have noticed I avoided using the word failure; I prefer to frame such experiences as \u201clearning opportunities.\u201d As my mother used to tell me, \u201cNothing is wasted.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>I encourage you all to be open to serendipity. Sometimes the path you initially set out on doesn\u2019t work out. But that\u2019s okay because something else \u2013perhaps something completely unexpected \u2013will surely come along. Be open and flexible when such opportunities arise. For example, I never imagined I would become a diplomat, never having met any diplomats before my Peace Corps service as a teacher in the now-Democratic Republic of the Congo.\u00a0 Look at me now!<\/li>\n<li>While it is normal to find inspiration in role models, don\u2019t compare yourself to others.\u00a0 There will always be someone more intelligent or more talented than you. That\u2019s okay, because there will only ever be one you! In this socially networked world, it\u2019s too easy to feel inadequate compared with your peer\u2019s carefully curated images. It is tempting to worry that you are falling behind somehow. Remember, there is no one-size-fits-all schedule. Focus on being the best you that you can be!\u00a0 This will also allow you to be a credible mentor to others.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Be kind to others along the way; you never know when you\u2019ll come across them again.\u00a0 We are all connected, and it matters how we treat people from all walks of life.\u00a0 This becomes especially true when we reach positions of leadership and become responsible for setting the tone for organizations and more junior colleagues.\u00a0 Be humble and express your gratitude to those who work with and support you. Share your successes with your team, and take responsibility for, and lead the way when analyzing, \u201clearning opportunities.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>These pieces of advice have helped me, and I hope they help you as well!\u00a0 But this isn\u2019t just about how we succeed as individuals.\u00a0 We all know that when women succeed, children are healthier and better educated, and communities thrive. Women\u2019s economic development lifts our nations up.\u00a0 Women today here in Ghana, in the United States, and around the world are key elements\u00a0 of the economic engine of business.<\/p>\n<p>Women need mentors to succeed for so many reasons!\u00a0 First of all, anyone who enters the entrepreneurial worldis a risk taker, and that takes courage in and of itself.\u00a0 Second, it takes persistence and innovation ,to succeed in any field.\u00a0 And third, entrepreneurs create jobs.<\/p>\n<p>The United States strongly support\u2019s Ghana\u2019s goal to create the jobs needed for members of the growing youth population to build their dreams here at home.\u00a0I\u2019m proud that many alumnae of U.S. exchange programs, some of whom are with us today, are making your own mark, as well as mentoring others, to strengthen Ghana\u2019s private sector.<\/p>\n<p>In closing, mentoring is not a uniquely female pursuit, as men have been mentoring other men for generations and men can also mentor women. Everyone needs mentors, irrespective of gender, but because we still have a long way to go for gender equality in business, politics, civic life, or even domestic life, we women need to mentor other women for our communities to be the best communities they can be.<\/p>\n<p>Those of you here today, and those whom you will mentor and encourage, have an opportunity to write a new story for women in Ghana and women across Africa\u2026 a story of powerful women business leaders, civic leaders, and entrepreneurs who become the driving force for greater peace and prosperity.\u00a0 Mentor another woman: do it for yourself, do it for your community, and do it for your country!<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ambassador Stephanie Sullivan\u2019s Remarks at the Mentoring Women Forum Standard Chartered Head Office, Accra, Ghana Thursday, January 9, 2020; 4:30 \u2013 6:00 p.m. &nbsp; Mentoring Women Ghana Executive Director Brigitte Dzogbenuku; Participants in today\u2019s mentoring program; Good afternoon.
