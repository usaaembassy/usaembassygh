The boat, known as the \u201cHealth Voyager,\u201d will serve 30 percent of the entire population in the Oti region \u2013 more than 230,000 people across 185 island communities in four districts.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The United States is committed to ensuring that all Ghanaians \u2014 regardless of their location \u2013 have access to quality health care,\u201d said USAID\/Ghana Health Office Director, Dr. Zohra Balsara. \u201cUSAID\u2019s donations embody our commitment to enhancing primary health care services in Ghana.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Island communities along the Volta Lake are often cut off from health services due to geographical barriers. The Health Voyager, designed and manufactured in Ghana, was custom-made to navigate the expansive Volta Lake. The boat will reshape the healthcare service delivery landscape along the Volta Lake coast, allowing community health staff to conduct routine outreach visits including childhood vaccinations, pregnant women checkups, and counseling for nurturing underweight children.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the United States recently renovated a boat for the Volta Region, which is now serving 54,000 people across 45 island communities. USAID also donated four pick-up trucks and 30 motorcycles\u2013contributing to the total of over 300 motorcycles and 20 vehicles the United States has donated to the Ghana Health Service over the past year. These are all crucial assets that will support healthcare delivery across Ghana and ensure the Ghana Health Service can implement its community outreach or CHPS Primary Health Care delivery model.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is Ghana\u2019s largest bilateral development donor.\u00a0 In 2023, USAID\u2019s bilateral development assistance totaling over $140 million was dedicated to supporting health, economic growth, agriculture, education, governance, and security in Ghana.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About USAID<\/strong><br \/>\nUSAID is the lead U.S. Government agency that works to end extreme global poverty and enable resilient, democratic societies to realize their potential.
