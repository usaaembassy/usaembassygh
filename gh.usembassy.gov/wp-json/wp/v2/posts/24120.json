This gathering is a testament not only to our shared commitment to maritime security but also to the enduring partnership between our nations and the continent of Africa.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Here in West Africa, peacebuilding and security are never far from our minds.\u00a0 Ghana has been fortunate, so far, in avoiding violent extremist attacks.\u00a0 As you know, some of Ghana\u2019s neighbors have not been so lucky.\u00a0 As His Excellency the President noted at the very beginning of his State of the Nation address earlier this year, \u201cWest Africa is under threat of terrorism and violent extremism,\u201d and that countries in this region \u201ccan no longer take our territorial integrity for granted.\u201d\u00a0 These are indeed times in which the work and collaboration of everyone in this room is critical.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ghana has long been a leader in regional security and an exporter of peace.\u00a0 We greatly respect and appreciate Ghana\u2019s role as a top contributor of uniformed peacekeepers to UN peace operations.\u00a0 Ghana\u2019s commitment to, and leadership in, regional peace and security has been on full display through your deployment of over 2,600 military and police personnel to UN peacekeeping operations in Africa and the Middle East.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">I must also acknowledge Ghana\u2019s strong advocacy for democracy in the region, which has also been challenged greatly by events in the last few years. Ghana\u2019s leadership as a member of the UN Security Council as Chairman of ECOWAS, influential member of the African Union, and home to the African Continental Free Trade Agreement Secretariat demonstrates its critical and growing role in security, stability, development, and economic prosperity for West Africa.\u00a0 Its peaceful elections and subordination of the military to civilian authority are models for the region and beyond.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">The United States works closely with Ghana and many regional partners to build the capacity of security forces on and offshore.\u00a0 That includes technical trainings at the GAF Engineering School, maritime maintenance training at Naval Base Sekondi, and naval infrastructure projects at NAVTRAC. It also includes equipment to build the capacity of the Ghana Navy, like the two 87-foot coastal security ships bolstering maritime security capacity in the Gulf of Guinea.\u00a0 We also provided $6 million in additional equipment to the Special Boat Squadron and projects at NAVTRAC, part of the $28 million in U.S. security assistance to Ghana last year.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_24125\" aria-labelledby=\"figcaption_attachment_24125\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 760px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-24125 size-large\" title=\"IMG_5217\" src=\"https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/IMG_5218-750x500.jpg\" alt=\"Ambassador Palmer addresses the African Maritime Forces Summit and Naval Infantry Leadership Symposium - Africa\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/IMG_5218-750x500.jpg 750w, https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/IMG_5218-350x233.jpg 350w, https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/IMG_5218-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/IMG_5218-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/IMG_5218-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/IMG_5218-200x133.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" \/><figcaption id=\"figcaption_attachment_24125\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Forty countries are participating in the African Maritime Forces Summit and Naval Infantry Leadership Symposium &#8211; Africa, April 29-May 2 in Accra<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Our security cooperation, however, goes far beyond equipment.\u00a0 It\u2019s about building a long-term partnership, learning from each other, sharing best practices, and training together.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Next month, Ghana will host and participate in multiple international military training exercises: Obangame Express, African Lion, and Flintlock.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">But we know that fostering peace and ensuring stability is about more than having well-trained and experienced security forces.\u00a0 Through multi-year implementation of the U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability (SPCPS), the U.S. Government is working across Coastal West Africa to promote social cohesion, inclusive economic growth, and accountable governance in order to prevent conflict.\u00a0 Development \u2013 along with professional security forces offering real security to vulnerable populations is key to halting the spread of violent extremism.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">This week is dedicated to African maritime security and cooperation, which are key elements of regional security.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">This summit, &#8220;Cooperation at Sea: Safeguarding African Maritime Security,&#8221; comes at a critical time.\u00a0 Our seas \u2013 especially the Gulf of Guinea \u2013 are bridges that connect us, and serve as channels for trade and shared prosperity. These waters, however, are also frontlines in our joint efforts to combat piracy, illegal fishing, and illicit trafficking \u2014 challenges that no single nation can effectively face alone.\u00a0 Our discussions and subsequent actions must lead to effective countering and prosecution of these activities.<\/p>\n<p>Our agenda over the next few days is ambitious to enhance our naval capabilities, to foster interoperability, and to build the crisis response capacities that African maritime forces need to ensure security and stability. We recognize that effective maritime security is about more than ships and equipment; it&#8217;s about the partnerships we forge.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Our collaboration here in Accra is an opportunity to strengthen the ties that bind us across oceans and to reinforce our collective resolve to face maritime threats head-on.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">In conclusion, let us emerge from these sessions with a renewed commitment to collaboration, equipped with practical solutions that reflect our collective wisdom and resolve. Together, we can ensure that African waters remain lanes of prosperity and peace, safeguarded by effective and enduring partnerships.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For more information on the African Maritime Forces Summit, Naval Infantry Leaders Symposium-Africa, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dvidshub.net\/feature\/AMFSNILSA2024\">click here<\/a> U.S. Ambassador Palmer\u2019s Remarks Opening Ceremony of the African Maritime Forces Summit \/ Naval Infantry Leaders Symposium \u2013 Africa (NILSA) April 30, 2024 *Remarks As Prepared* Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues, and distinguished guests, Good Morning!
