But there was something extra special about United Accord this year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ghana didn\u2019t just host this year. \u00a0Ghana didn\u2019t just <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">receive<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> training. \u00a0More than 60 U.S. soldiers spent a week at Ghana\u2019s Jungle Warfare School at Achiase Military Base \u2014 making this the first time an African partner nation <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">trained<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> U.S. Army forces. \u00a0If you haven\u2019t seen the reporting on this, I highly recommend that you check out the videos online. \u00a0U.S. armed forces described the training as eye-opening, demanding, and grueling \u2026 but also as important, memorable, and critical to our ability to counter threats alongside the Ghana Armed Forces. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These are U.S. soldiers who are now better able to defend the United States and our allies, because of training they received <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">here<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That\u2019s the partnership of the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Also last month, we launched the Blood Safety Information System. \u00a0Ghana is only the second country in Africa to implement this system, which tracks blood donations from donor to recipient to ensure a safe, reliable blood supply. Thanks to the leadership of Ghana\u2019s National Blood Service, we can share knowledge back and forth about how we manage our blood supplies \u2014 information that helps us both to protect the health of our citizens. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That\u2019s the partnership of the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And let\u2019s not overlook the critical role of the private sector. \u00a0I know the finance minister feels as strongly about this as I do. \u00a0The American and Ghanaian private sectors are driving forces that can and will cast vision, transform economies, create jobs, and ultimately strengthen our bilateral relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Last week, a delegation of eight Ghanaian businesses travelled to the United States for the SelectUSA Summit, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> highest profile event to promote foreign direct investment in the United States. \u00a0This was not just the first time a delegation from Ghana attended this Summit. \u00a0It was the first time a delegation from <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Africa<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> attended this Summit. \u00a0At the same time, American companies are establishing <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and expanding their operations in Ghana, making investments and creating opportunities for Ghanaian and American citizens. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And so when I\u2019m asked why we invest in development programs in Ghana, it\u2019s because we see the results. \u00a0I see how that investment makes us stronger partners for the future. \u00a0We invest in agricultural programs because food security promotes national security. \u00a0We invest in reading programs because educated children become forward-thinking adults and future leaders. \u00a0We are investing in the energy sector because none of this can happen without reliable, affordable power. \u00a0Power is critical to Ghana\u2019s economic success and industrialization. \u00a0And let me say that I truly believe that \u2014 60 years from now \u2014 decades after it has been transformed through Millennium Challenge Compact II, ECG will be a profitable, functional entity that supplies Ghana with the power it needs to participate fully in the global economy and the global community, from Flagstaff House out to the farthest, most rural, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">electrified<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sixty years from now, God willing, another U.S. ambassador will be standing here making a speech celebrating the 301<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">st<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> anniversary of American independence. \u00a0I hope some of you will be there. \u00a0I hope you\u2019ll tell the ambassador how you\u2019ve watched the U.S.-Ghana partnership strengthen and grow and change the world. \u00a0I hope you\u2019ll tell the ambassador how you\u2019ve <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">helped<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> the U.S.-Ghana partnership strengthen and grow and change the world. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Before closing, I want to thank my many colleagues here at the Embassy who worked very hard to make this event a success, especially Jennifer Mauldin and Margaret Langer. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I also want to thank our generous sponsors for tonight\u2019s event. \u00a0I am truly gratified by the strong support we receive from our American business community. \u00a0I am equally proud of the great contributions American companies are making here in Ghana every day. \u00a0American businesses work collaboratively with our Ghanaian counterparts, bringing together the best aspects of our business cultures. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Forty-four American companies, American franchises, and distributors of American products contributed to make this event happen. \u00a0We have highlighted each one on the backdrop behind me and on the TV monitor. \u00a0Since none of us here tonight would be enjoying this celebration without their generous financial support, please allow me to share the list of this year\u2019s donors:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">American Products
