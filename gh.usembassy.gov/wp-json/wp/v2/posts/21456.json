In May 2019, I had the honor of participating in the launch of YOLO Series Season 5 at the Silverbird Cinemas in West Hills Mall. \u00a0I felt the excitement in the room as we met the stars and watched some episodes together.\u00a0 I picked small small pidgin!\u00a0 The plot twists in YOLO are gripping and the drama is exhilarating.\u00a0 We are drawn to YOLO because it portrays real life experiences for youth across Ghana and around the world, evoking the promise of a brighter, healthier future.<\/p>\n<p>For over twenty years, the United States has supported the Government of Ghana, the private sector, and civil society to implement social and behavior change activities, encouraging Ghanaians, including youth in particular, to lead productive, healthy lives.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to commend the Government of Ghana &#8212; especially the National Population Council, the Ghana Health Service, and their media partners &#8212; for their leadership in making adolescent health a priority.\u00a0 The United States is proud of our partnership with the Government of Ghana and Farmhouse Productions to produce YOLO Seasons 3, 4, and 5.<\/p>\n<p>The active participation and leadership of youth in society are vital to a country\u2019s development.\u00a0 We know the challenges such as youth unemployment and teenage pregnancy that impede the needed participation of young people. \u00a0YOLO tackles these important issues in real, frank, and open discussions.<\/p>\n<p>The \u201cWhat Does YOLO Mean To Me?\u201d series is our response to a message we heard loud and clear \u2013 you need more of YOLO!\u00a0 The series includes clips from previous YOLO episodes and interviews with YOLO fans across Ghana. These are a window into the lives of youth across the length and breadth of Ghana.\u00a0 You opened your hearts and shared personal trials and tribulations through mobile diary videos. You shared your conversations with friends, talking about tough issues like cyber bulling, sex, and how to create a safe space to talk openly to your parents.<\/p>\n<p>The clips are linked to the Ghana Health Service\u2019s GoodLife Campaign social media sites to reinforce healthy messages.\u00a0 It takes courage to ask for help; it takes bravery to be vulnerable.\u00a0 If you need help, resources, or a listening ear, ah beg, seek out services at health facility \u201cYouth Corners\u201d or through the Ghana Health Service online counselling platform.<\/p>\n<p>I would like to say a resounding \u201cAyekoo\u201d for the impressive awards the YOLO series and its actors have won in recent years, including a \u201cLife Changing\u201d award for positive influence on youth by the University of Cape Coast; and the 2016 Ghana Movie Awards for best serial drama, best director, and 6 &#8211; count \u2018em 6 &#8211; best actor\/actress awards.<\/p>\n<p>However, the greatest gift YOLO characters have given to youth in Ghana, and across the world, is their example of healthy and positive living, their overcoming trials with resilience and grit, and their consistent optimism, despite obstacles. The YOLO actors are both world-renowned stars and role models who have entered the households of all Ghanaian youth.<\/p>\n<p>To Ghana\u2019s young people, I know the pandemic has been particularly difficult for you. You haven\u2019t been able to socialize in person with your friends. \u00a0Some of you may not have had access to key services during the periods of lockdown and social isolation.\u00a0 Yet you\u2019ve persevered and learned to adapt.\u00a0 Keep making smart choices, choosing the right relationships, showing respect and integrity both offline and online, and believing in yourself and your future.
