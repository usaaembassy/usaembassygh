In doing so, he has served as an advocate for millions of people, giving them greater access to essential services and a greater voice in how they are governed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I read a recent interview with Professor Gyimah-Boadi in which he expressed his belief that democracy will continue to thrive in Ghana; that it will buttress democracy throughout the continent; and that a young generation of Africans, empowered by education, social media and new technologies \u2014 empowered by information \u2014 will claim their right to be heard. \u00a0I believe in that vision of the future, too \u2014 in no small part because I see <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">him<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> doing everything in his power to make it so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The CDD, under Professor Gyimah-Boadi\u2019s leadership, has contributed to shaping positive political outcomes across the continent. \u00a0Last year, the Center again played a tremendous role in Ghana\u2019s credible elections and peaceful transfer of power. \u00a0Together with CODEO \u2014 which was established under the auspices of CDD \u2014 the Center worked tirelessly to promote electoral reform and ensure campaigns and candidates addressed real issues, particularly those affecting women, youth, people with disabilities, and people living with HIV and AIDS. \u00a0Professor Gyimah-Boadi\u2019s leadership ensured that Ghanaians had information about their election and that their right to freely choose their leaders was protected. \u00a0That work continues post-election. \u00a0The Center\u2019s \u201cI Am Aware\u201d campaign provides information on services provided in districts and constituencies around Ghana so that citizens can hold government accountable. \u00a0It\u2019s information that gives people power to stand up for their rights. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And if we\u2019re going to talk about the importance of information, what greater source do we have about the wants and needs of African citizens than Afrobarometer? \u00a0The research conducted by Professor Gyimah-Boadi and his colleagues has given the ordinary man or woman on the street a voice \u2014 an opportunity to express their opinions on the issues that affect their daily lives: health, corruption, access to justice, education, and more. \u00a0This treasure trove of rich and comprehensive data from dozens of countries sparks dialogue among governments, civil society organizations, journalists, investors, regular citizens \u2014 anyone who feels their stake in the future of Africa. \u00a0In fact, just this past month, Afrobarometer\u2019s research was at the center of a policy brief presented to the G20 on how G20-Africa cooperation can better align with the priorities of everyday Africans.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Professor Gyimah-Boadi understands that when the will of people is known, they can be included in policy decisions. \u00a0When citizens can compare the progress their government is making with other governments across the continent, they can challenge the status quo. \u00a0They can demand better services. \u00a0They can demand transparency and accountability. \u00a0And when citizens are satisfied that their government is responsive and accountable, peace and stability follow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These are not easy issues to tackle, in any country. \u00a0But Professor Gyimah-Boadi has dedicated his life to doing just that, in multiple countries \u2014 and democracy, social justice and equality across the continent are stronger because of it. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The book Strength to Love is a collection of Dr. King\u2019s sermons. \u00a0In it, he laments what he calls \u201csoft-mindedness,\u201d and asserts the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThe tough mind is sharp and penetrating, breaking through the crust of legends and myths and sifting the true from the false. The tough-minded individual is astute and discerning \u2026 Rarely do we find men who willingly engage in hard, solid thinking. \u00a0There is an almost universal quest for easy answers and half-baked solutions.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Professor Gyimah-Boadi is one of those rare men. \u00a0I think Dr. King would respect the way he has asked hard questions and discerned the truth. \u00a0I think he would be pleased with his tireless efforts to inform the people, so they can stand up for their rights and demand good governance and accountability. \u00a0I think Dr. King would respect the way he has constructively challenged governments, civil society, citizens, and all of us to think about the future of Africa, the future of democracy, and our responsibility to ensure peace, justice and equality for all. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It is now my honor to call on Professor Gyimah-Boadi to receive the 2017 Martin Luther King, Jr. Award for Peace and Social Justice.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning.
