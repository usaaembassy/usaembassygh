The Ambassador held meetings with the Northern Regional Minister and Chairman of the Regional Security Council Honorable Shanui Alhassan Shaibu, as well as with representatives of the Northern Regional Peace Council and West African Network for Peacebuilding. The Ambassador also met with many traditional leaders: Overlord of Dagbon Ya-Naa Abukari II, Mion Lana Abdulai Mahamadu, Paramount Chief of Buipe, Buipewura Abdulai Jinapor II, and Paramount Chief of Salaga, Kpembewura Bangabe Ndefuso IV.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMaintaining peace is necessary for development.

She highlighted projects by United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to support initiatives to equip traditional authorities and Regional Peace Councils with the skills and knowledge to mediate conflicts in their jurisdictions. This support has improved the sustainability of mediated disputes, formalized community land-use procedures, promoted the use of alternate dispute resolution approaches, and encouraged inclusive governance.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_22374\" aria-labelledby=\"figcaption_attachment_22374\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 760px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-large wp-image-22374\" title=\"Ambassador Sullivan\u2019s Trip to Tamale-8\" src=\"https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/Ambassador-Sullivans-Trip-to-Tamale-8-750x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/Ambassador-Sullivans-Trip-to-Tamale-8-750x500.jpg 750w, https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/Ambassador-Sullivans-Trip-to-Tamale-8-350x233.jpg 350w, https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/Ambassador-Sullivans-Trip-to-Tamale-8-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/Ambassador-Sullivans-Trip-to-Tamale-8-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/Ambassador-Sullivans-Trip-to-Tamale-8-200x133.jpg 200w, https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/Ambassador-Sullivans-Trip-to-Tamale-8.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" \/><figcaption id=\"figcaption_attachment_22374\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">U.S. Ambassador Stephanie Sullivan visits the port in Buipe, Savannah Region, Ghana, March 2022<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Ambassador Sullivan visited the Buipe Port in the Savannah Region on Monday.
