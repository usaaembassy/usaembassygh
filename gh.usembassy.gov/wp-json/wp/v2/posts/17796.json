Kirby Simon Foreign Service Trust, are supporting the development and promotion of America\u2019s national pastime in Ghana with a presentation of equipment to the Ghana Baseball and Softball Association. The 20-piece equipment donation of bats, balls and gloves will be used by Ghana\u2019s junior and senior national teams as they prepare for upcoming international competitions.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe equipment that was granted to us by the J. Kirby Simon Foreign Service Trust is going to help Ghana\u2019s Little League team in a long way, as we all know that Little League players grow to become big league players,\u201d said Jamiu Salami, Ghana national head coach. &#8220;They need lots of attention and the gift from the Americans will help in the development of baseball in Ghana.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Coach Salami continued: \u201cBaseball and softball mean a lot to us and, as Ghana\u2019s head coach, I will be glad if we can continue to work with the U.S. Embassy and other American entities in Ghana interested in helping us develop our talents and our playing facilities. I will be most grateful if our dreams of producing Ghanaian players in Major League Baseball become a reality through the Americans.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The J. Kirby Simon Trust makes small grants on a competitive basis to individuals affiliated with U.S. embassies and consulates around the world. U.S. Embassy staff applied for a small grant in 2016 and received funding from the Trust to provide a selection of bats, balls and gloves to the Association.<\/p>\n<p>U.S. Embassy Defense Attach\u00e9 LtCol Jano Carlson added, \u201cJust two months ago, we saw South Africa\u2019s Gift Ngoepe become the first African-born player in Major League Baseball. We would absolutely love to see Ghanaians join the ranks of MLB players. We\u2019ve played some friendly games against Ghanaian teams and have seen first-hand that they are truly exceptional players with tremendous passion for these sports.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Carlson went on to say, \u201cThis kind gift from the Trust to Ghana\u2019s baseball and softball teams provides much-needed equipment to both teams. We hope that this grant will help to grow our friendship even further and to attract new players \u2014 Ghanaian, American, and expat alike. Ultimately, we believe this grant is \u2018Diplomacy through sport,\u2019 by way of our Great American pastime.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The J. Kirby Simon Foreign Service Trust is a charitable fund established in the memory of Kirby Simon, a Foreign Service officer who died in 1995 while serving in Taiwan. The Trust is committed to expanding the opportunities for community service, professional fulfillment and personal well-being of Foreign Service officers, specialists and their families. The Trust has been funded with contributions from Kirby Simon\u2019s colleagues, friends and relatives.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Accra, GHANA\u00a0\u2013 Staff of the U.S. Embassy, through a small grant from the J.
