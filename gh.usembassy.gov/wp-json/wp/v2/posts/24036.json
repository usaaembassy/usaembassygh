Morning!<\/p>\n<p>Normally, I confess, I rush through the protocols because in Ghana we do the protocols over and over again, but I don\u2019t want to today because I am so honored and humbled to be with you all.\u00a0 Because you are \u2013 no kidding \u2013 essential to Ghanaian and world confidence in your democracy.\u00a0 And increasingly to Ghanaian and world confidence in democracy period.\u00a0 That\u2019s more important than ever as democracy has had tremendous challenges in West Africa in recent years. \u00a0Frankly, as my own country has learned it\u2019s not something that we say \u201cwe\u2019ve had democracy for two hundred years let\u2019s sit back and enjoy it\u201d\u2026 You have to fight for it every day.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve learned that the hard way ourselves in recent times. \u00a0The press and election institutions \u2013 and this wonderful novel National Peace Council and Regional Peace Councils that Ghana has that could be models for the rest of the region \u2013 are incredibly important to that.\u00a0 Public confidence in elections is an incredibly important element of democracy.<\/p>\n<p>I often think about the U.S. experience of Gore vs. Bush and the challenges that my African friends gave me at the time.\u00a0 Americans weren\u2019t particularly worried because we had a lot of confidence in our courts in particular.\u00a0 Also in that the parties would eventually, would fight hard, but would play by the rules.\u00a0 Our confidence in that allowed the process to play out.\u00a0 That\u2019s extraordinarily important.<\/p>\n<p>I want to thank Albert Dwumfour, GJA President, for your invitation and for co-sponsoring this with the U.S. Embassy.<\/p>\n<p>Ghana and the United States have a lot in common.\u00a0 I reflect on this when we talk about elections.\u00a0 As we edge closer to the 2024 presidential elections in both countries, the role of a free, vibrant, and professional press has never been more paramount.\u00a0 We gather today at a critical juncture in our history at a time when the strength of democracy is being tested worldwide and challenged.<\/p>\n<p>We share a lot of the same challenges when it comes to elections as well: challenges to democracy and disinformation aimed at sowing mistrust in our institutions and our elections.\u00a0 This type of disinformation, often driven by state actors \u2013 you know who I am talking about \u2013 undermines democracy and confidence in government.<\/p>\n<p>Because when democracies like ours succeed, authoritarian regimes fail.\u00a0 So, they will do whatever is possible to harm democratic processes and sow division and doubt.<\/p>\n<p>If they can undermine democracy in the world, their authoritarian, top-down, command and control approach to the world can seem like a plausible alternative.\u00a0 Of course, it\u2019s not.\u00a0 Their approach to the world cannot win the war of ideas, so they use disinformation and seek to undermine institutions and trust in government and in the press.<\/p>\n<p>West Africa, as I mentioned at the top, has experienced democratic backsliding in the last few years, as four governments in the Sahel have fallen victim to coups.\u00a0 And it\u2019s important to point out that many analysts saw a rise in disinformation online that preceded that that undermined confidence in the government.\u00a0 That\u2019s not to say these governments were perfect, in fact flaws in democracy in those places played a huge role but it seems likely that disinformation spread through social media targeted these governments and accelerated their downfall.\u00a0 We saw that pattern repeated in Niger last year.<\/p>\n<p>Coups like these take the power from the people\u2019s hands and put it squarely in the hands of a few, usually the military.<\/p>\n<p>Ghana\u2019s had that history.\u00a0 I\u2019m looking around the table wondering if there is anybody here old enough to have real memories of what that means.\u00a0 There\u2019s a real division between people who have lived experience of what that deprivation of rights means, and others who might be tempted to think \u201cthat\u2019s expedient or that will get me out of the economic doldrums or a counterterrorism crisis.\u201d\u00a0 But it doesn\u2019t work that way.<\/p>\n<p>Even when a coup initially has popular support, it\u2019s not long before people come to realize that an authoritarian regime is not the answer to security challenges or economic malaise. \u00a0You can look at, for example, the number of civilian deaths in these coup countries and they\u2019ve gone up, rather than down, even though that was the excuse for the coup in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>When a democratic government fails to live up to expectations, the solution is actually MORE democracy, NOT LESS. \u00a0That\u2019s important to remind people. \u00a0We see it in the Sahel, where human rights violations by security forces and discrimination \u2013 I do want us all to think about discrimination \u2013 drive violent extremists and recruitment.\u00a0 We also see it where the failure to equitably share economic dividends drives people to seek change.<\/p>\n<p>The change we need is the professionalization of the security forces and structuring our economies to ensure that economic prosperity is shared across classes, regions, and sub-groups, again without discrimination.\u00a0 The solution to corruption is more democratic governance, more rule of law, more accountability.\u00a0 Not less.<\/p>\n<p>Ghana has long been a regional example of stability and democratic success.\u00a0 But again, across the region, that\u2019s under threat.\u00a0 We cannot take it for granted.<\/p>\n<p>Journalists are the absolute lynchpin or bedrock (the internet is down this morning so I couldn\u2019t look for more synonyms). \u00a0You are absolutely essential to making that true and to protecting those values.<\/p>\n<p>I know you face threats, both physical and digital, that seek to silence critical voices and stifle press freedom. \u00a0The courage to report honestly in such an environment is commendable.\u00a0 I salute you for it, I really do, I hope to see more of it. \u00a0It\u2019s a testament to the resilience and dedication of the journalist community.<\/p>\n<p>I sit here horrified and respectful when you talk about journalists that could be killed.\u00a0 I hope that won\u2019t happen and we will do everything we can to make sure that you are not threatened in those ways.\u00a0 Your courage to want to report the story and report the truth, no matter what, is so important to democracy.<\/p>\n<p>It is a collective responsibility \u2013 governments, civil society, and the international community \u2013 to protect, support, and champion the rights of journalists and media organizations.\u00a0 Because your safety and freedom are indispensable to the health of our democracies.<\/p>\n<p>Your part of the bargain \u2013 and we\u2019ve talked about accuracy not just getting the scoop \u2013 your part of the bargain is to tell the truth including by shining the light on corruption and discrimination and other threats to democracy.<\/p>\n<p>We all know that free and fair elections don\u2019t just happen on Election Day.\u00a0 The period before and after is extraordinarily important.\u00a0 They happen because people like you \u2013 journalists, law enforcement, civil society, and government officials \u2013 work together to ensure the systems work, the processes are transparent, and the results are credible.<\/p>\n<p>Again, we know how much work that takes.\u00a0 Work doesn\u2019t just start on Election Day, so thank you for your work now and throughout this year \u2026 and immediately following the election and from then on to ensure not just democracy and democratic elections but good governance.<\/p>\n<p>The team at the U.S. Embassy will be similarly focused throughout this year on elections.\u00a0 Just like you, we know that our support must continue every day to build and protect democratic processes and institutions that work for the people.<\/p>\n<p>I will give a couple examples of how we do that:<\/p>\n<p>USAID is working through the National Peace Council to build consensus for transparency, long-term election reforms, and preventing election-related conflicts. \u00a0And through the Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability I\u2019m interested to see how that model can be replicated across West Africa because it is a beautiful innovation.<\/p>\n<p>USAID also works with marginalized communities to promote their active participation in electoral processes, including access to the Ghana Card, which is essential.\u00a0 They will also work with potential candidates from marginalized communities to improve their chances of running for office in the future.\u00a0 They will support Civil Society Organizations in their efforts to monitor and report on campaign financing.\u00a0 Many of these efforts are long-term and go beyond the 2024 elections.<\/p>\n<p>On Election Day, that\u2019s not when you see most violence and intimidation, but on Election Day and for some time before and after we will have teams deployed looking to see what\u2019s going on around the country.<\/p>\n<p>But before that, we have a robust set of training and technical assistance programs planned for this year.\u00a0 Today\u2019s program is one such example.\u00a0 With the GJA, you mentioned this, we are supporting five regional training sessions for more than 100 journalists, providing training on best practices for elections reporting.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s kind of a neat innovation that you will receive mentoring and feedback on your elections reporting going forward.<\/p>\n<p>I know that there\u2019s a reporter from Ghana\u2019s Citi News actually in the United States this week on a reporting tour, covering how local, state, and federal elections work.\u00a0 Again, we say that with humility, it\u2019s not that the United States has perfect elections, we don\u2019t. \u00a0But because there are lessons we can learn from each other and because the reporting on those elections \u2013 perfect or imperfect \u2013 is incredibly important.\u00a0 Another journalist has been nominated for a virtual reporting tour on the U.S. elections that will continue with briefings through November.<\/p>\n<p>To engage young people and first-time voters, our American Corners in Accra and Kumasi will host election literacy programs to provide forums for young people to understand their responsibilities and their role in the elections process.\u00a0 I need to be clear, these are not candidate forums.\u00a0 In fact, no candidates will participate.\u00a0 They will be talking about processes, issues, and how to express your individual opinions on public policy issues through voting.\u00a0 And how to make those votes count and make those opinions count with candidates, parties, and others.\u00a0 Our partners in Kumasi will even hold a spoken word contest among high school students to highlight the importance of free and fair elections.<\/p>\n<p>And, finally, we\u2019re also providing training to build resilience against elections related mis and disinformation this year.\u00a0 Our guest speaker today, Sarah Wachter, is a subject matter expert on the confluence of journalism and election related disinformation.\u00a0 I popped in on a training she was doing a couple days ago and it was fascinating, a very sophisticated discussion with the participants.\u00a0 So, I\u2019m jealous of all of you and the discussions you will have today.<\/p>\n<p>I also want to highlight for this group that we have open now a request for funding proposals for projects related to peaceful elections.\u00a0 That deadline is coming up fast, so I encourage you to look at the website, I know you have already and to spread the word.\u00a0 It\u2019s about $150,000 this year \u2013 close to two million cedi \u2013 for up to five projects.<\/p>\n<p>Again, thank you to GJA for putting this program together.\u00a0 Thank you, our journalists, for what you do for free and fair elections, your courage and your professionalism have never been more important, so thank you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ambassador Palmer\u2019s Remarks to Ghana Journalists Association\u2019s Elections Training Friday, March 15, 2024 *As Delivered* \u00a0 Good
