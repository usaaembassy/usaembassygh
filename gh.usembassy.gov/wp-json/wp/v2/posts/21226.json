CODEO\u2019s outstanding work in election observation has been recognized over the years as one that demonstrates neutrality, impartiality, and integrity. \u00a0That is why the U.S. government, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), prioritized supporting CDD and CODEO in their efforts to establish the National Information Center for this year\u2019s election. \u00a0This center will serve as CODEO\u2019s operational base for the Parallel Vote Tabulation, as well as a repository for reports from CODEO election observers who will deploy across the country. \u00a0Indeed, CODEO\u2019s Parallel Vote Tabulation will be an additional resource to help support the Electoral Commission to ensure a free and fair election.<\/p>\n<p>As the country prepares for its eighth general election, I\u2019d like to applaud Ghana\u2019s leadership in providing a strong example of democracy not only in the region but also across the world. \u00a0During the Fourth Republic, Ghana has made considerable strides in democratic governance by preserving the rule of law, safeguarding it with a free press, and promoting the delivery of essential services to all its citizens, irrespective of status, beliefs, or circumstance.<\/p>\n<p>Democracy requires the active participation of citizens.\u00a0 Democracy suffers in complacency, and all democratic nations must remain vigilant, especially during election season. \u00a0For the upcoming elections to be successful, all concerned must foster an environment that respects the law and allows for the free and unfettered exercise of individuals\u2019 right to vote.<\/p>\n<p>A serious threat to democracy anywhere in the world is the threat of electoral violence. \u00a0Violence can only create an environment of fear and back the clock of progress. \u00a0None of us wants to see that happen. \u00a0Political ambition shouldn\u2019t be allowed to tear down what has taken generations for Ghanaians to build.<\/p>\n<p>As Ghana prepares for its upcoming elections, we also need to remember that COVID-19 is still all around us. \u00a0We have a responsibility to keep ourselves, our families and friends safe from this disease. We can best do that by adhering strictly to the measures the Ministry of Health has put in place to stem the spread of the virus. \u00a0A community\u2019s health is an important pillar for development that we cannot take for granted.\u00a0 Let\u2019s all remember physical distancing and the need to wear a mask and wash or disinfect our hands-on election day in order to stop the virus to promote a healthy and productive future for all Ghana\u2019s citizens.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to end with a special message regarding the fourth estate of the realm \u2013 the media.\u00a0 A respected, protected, and accountable journalist corps is a key part of a transparent and fair electoral process.\u00a0 I encourage the media to engage in their craft safely and responsibly.<\/p>\n<p>It is paramount to the success of any democracy for institutions of national security and law enforcement to protect a free and responsible media environment, which allows the communication of facts upon which citizens can make informed decisions. Open channels of communication, including uninterrupted connectivity for all members of society, is key to the accountability and transparency needed for the success of the electoral process.<\/p>\n<p>In the next few days, the entire world will be watching to see how Ghana fares during this election. I\u2019m confident that Ghana will once again make the region, the continent, and the whole world proud. \u00a0I look forward to observing Ghanaians participate in another free, fair, peaceful, and credible election, a cornerstone of accountable governance.<\/p>\n<p>After the electoral process is over, I also look forward to seeing Ghanaians of all political parties work together to make Ghana\u2019s star shine even more brightly. Meanwhile, I wish Ghana and Ghanaians a successful and peaceful election.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for your kind attention.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Accra, GHANA\u2014 On December 3, 2020, U.S. Ambassador to Ghana Stephanie S.
