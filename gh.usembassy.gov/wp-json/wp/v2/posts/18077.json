Jackson"},"content":{"rendered":"<div style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px;\" class=\"sharethis-inline-share-buttons\" ><\/div><p>Your Excellency President Nana Addo Dankwah Akufo-Addo,<br \/>\nHonorable Minister of Communications Ursula Owusu-Ekuful,<br \/>\nColleagues from the Diplomatic Corps and the U.S. Mission,<br \/>\nDistinguished Ladies and Gentlemen,<\/p>\n<p>Good morning.\u00a0 I\u2019m delighted to see so many friends, business leaders, and members of the Government of Ghana here today.\u00a0 Thank you to the Minister of Communications for inviting me to participate in and support Ghana\u2019s National Cybersecurity Week Celebration.\u00a0 I also would like to thank Albert Antwi-Boasiako, the Cyber Security Advisor, for his good work over the past several months.\u00a0 Through our joint efforts and the Security Governance Initiative, we are fortifying Ghana\u2019s cybersecurity and capacity to fight cybercrime and strengthening the administration of justice.<\/p>\n<p>We all know that cybersecurity issues can have far-reaching effects.\u00a0 As President Trump noted in May, the United States must work with our allies and partners to create a \u201cglobally secure and resilient Internet,\u201d as our economic, political, and civil societies cannot thrive if we fail to protect our information infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>Businesses, governments, and private citizens have come to depend on an Internet that is open, secure, and reliable.\u00a0 Digital technology and connectivity are critical to our daily lives and we must act to protect against malicious actors that use the Internet to commit crimes.<\/p>\n<p>Cyber threats come from state-sponsored actors, criminal organizations, and individual actors.\u00a0 They can harm our security, do substantial damage to our infrastructure, and have an enormous impact on our economies.\u00a0 And there are threats that target internet users like you and me.\u00a0 A main concern in Ghana is debit card fraud.\u00a0 Criminals target retail outlets \u2013 stores, restaurants, and gas stations \u2013 where they steal our PIN numbers for their own use or to sell to others.\u00a0 Romance scams perpetrated via the Internet are also a real threat to ordinary people.\u00a0 Almost every day an American contacts my Embassy to say that\u00a0<strong>\u201cthe fianc\u00e9(e)\u201d<\/strong>\u00a0they met on the Internet had reported being involved in an accident and needing thousands of dollars for medical bills.\u00a0 They sent the money and have not heard from the fianc\u00e9 since.\u00a0 These fraudsters, often referred to as \u201csakawa boys\u201d, victimize people across the world and hurt Ghana\u2019s international reputation.\u00a0 The anonymity offered by the Internet requires users everywhere to be vigilant and take steps to verify and protect online information.\u00a0 As we develop responses to identified vulnerabilities, criminals are already looking to exploit another security gap.\u00a0 No single government or organization has all the resources and expertise required to combat the advanced and persistent cyberattacks that are being launched today.\u00a0 A vibrant partnership between the public and private sectors is essential to the implementation of an effective cybersecurity policy.<\/p>\n<p>Defending against the threat of cybercriminal activity requires a comprehensive and collaborative approach.\u00a0\u00a0Ghana is collaborating with international partners to combat cybercrime.\u00a0\u00a0Sharing technical expertise and implementing targeted training to conduct a critical infrastructure risk assessment to develop standard operating procedures for the newly created National Security Technical Working Group are critical.\u00a0 Ghana\u2019s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) stands ready to respond to cyberattacks.\u00a0 From the U.S. experience, I can tell you that staffing and resourcing a CERT is difficult, but it is also vital.\u00a0 I encourage everyone here \u2013 public, private and nonprofit \u2013 to work with CERT to secure their networks.<\/p>\n<p>It is also vitally important to foster a whole-of-government approach to effectively address these challenges, but there is no \u201cone size fits all\u201d solution to every challenge.\u00a0 Ghana\u2019s cybersecurity strategy must be tailored to Ghana\u2019s own realities, aspirations, and goals.\u00a0 It is ultimately up to the Government of Ghana, with input from the private sector and civil society, to articulate its objectives, define its priorities, and allocate resources to address the nation\u2019s cyber concerns.\u00a0 Ghana has already taken significant steps in this pursuit.\u00a0 The government developed a National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy, which is a living document that can be built upon as new technology and attack vectors develop.<\/p>\n<p>We applaud Ghana\u2019s efforts to accede to the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, an international treaty designed to address cybercrime by harmonizing national laws and increasing cooperation among nations.\u00a0 This is a significant step in bringing Ghana\u2019s already strong cybersecurity legal framework into greater alignment with the international community.\u00a0 When completed, it will form a foundation for our robust cooperation on combatting cyber-crimes against citizens across borders.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. President, Ministers, Ladies and Gentlemen, as we combat cybercrimes, we are mindful of the great benefits that technology offers in connecting people around the world.\u00a0 In fact, internet freedom is a right as well as a necessity for all nations and citizens around the world to prosper.\u00a0\u00a0Cyber risks do not outweigh the benefits of an open, secure, and reliable Internet, nor should they discourage businesses and people from using the Internet and digital media.\u00a0 The Internet is a powerful tool to express opinions, share information, and expose corruption.\u00a0 It is also the backbone of the innovative space that we all know as the digital economy.<\/p>\n<p>I am pleased that the Government of Ghana is committed to doing the hard work of identifying and addressing cyber threats to ensure the people of this nation can fully and more securely benefit from their right to access to the Internet and the fruits of information technology.\u00a0 This National Cybersecurity Week Celebration is an excellent time to bring cybersecurity stakeholders together to not only discuss Ghana\u2019s cyber threat environment, but also to develop innovative solutions that mitigate cyber threats and promote a culture of cyber awareness.\u00a0 The United States of America is proud to support Ghana\u2019s efforts to strengthen its cybersecurity capacity to enable Ghanaians to educate and prepare themselves through internet access to successfully compete in this 21<sup>st<\/sup>\u00a0century economy, thereby lifting this nation\u2019s economy to new heights.\u00a0 Together, we can make our shared vision a reality.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Your
