Jackson<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>November 28, 2017 | 10 a.m.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Good morning.\u00a0 How exciting to be here today for this exhibition and relaunch of AFAM Concept and JF Labs products.\u00a0 This American company has been marketing its products in Ghana for the past <strong><em>30<\/em><\/strong> years \u2014 isn\u2019t that amazing?\u00a0 Their local distributors ensure that salons and stylists from Accra to Paga have access to quality brands like Hawaiian Silky, Leisure Curl, and Vitale.<\/p>\n<p>As U.S. Ambassador, one of my priorities is to deepen our commercial engagement \u2014 and to do so in ways that benefit both Ghanaians <em>and<\/em> Americans.\u00a0 We want to create American jobs back home, but we also want to see new jobs created for Ghanaians.\u00a0 We see that happening, for example, in the restaurant industry.\u00a0 American chains like Pizza Hut and Pinkberry are establishing and expanding their presence in Ghana.\u00a0 We eagerly anticipate the opening of the new Marriott hotel near the airport.\u00a0 Other major American companies are also exploring the possibilities in the Ghanaian market.<\/p>\n<p>The beauty industry is a sector that offers great promise.\u00a0 The sector has shown remarkable growth over the past few years, with sales increasing more than 120 percent from last year alone.<\/p>\n<p>However, as this industry expands, so does the threat from counterfeit products.\u00a0 While some of these products are merely substandard, some are downright harmful \u2014 to the consumer and to the industry professionals using them.<\/p>\n<p>Choosing innovative, high-quality American products benefits everyone in the supply chain, not just the manufacturer.\u00a0 The local distributor and the salons reap the benefit of offering products they can stand behind, 100 percent.\u00a0 The stylists and the consumers can have confidence in safe products that help them look and feel their best.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s what American companies like AFAM Concept can offer \u2014 a sincere desire to be a trusted supplier for the Ghanaian market, and to have a positive impact on each one of your businesses.<\/p>\n<p>American companies are excited about investing in and doing business with Ghana.\u00a0 I applaud President Akufo-Addo\u2019s focus on making Ghana a better place to do business.\u00a0 We appreciate the positive steps already taken, and we encourage the government to redouble its efforts to protect intellectual property, seek out fake goods, and hold accountable those who defraud the public.<\/p>\n<p>There is enough room for both our economies to grow and prosper.\u00a0 As Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Ambassador Thomas Shannon said recently, \u201cThe Trump administration seeks to do business not just <em>in<\/em> Africa, but <em>with<\/em> Africa, moving the focus of our economic relationship \u2026 from aid to trade and investment.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I congratulate AFAM Concept and JF Labs on their success over the past 30 years, and I wish them the best as they relaunch their name and their brands.\u00a0 I look forward to seeing your products in salons and on shelves across Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ambassador Jackson joined Second Lady Samira Bawumia and more than 2,000 enthusiastic beauty professionals last week for the relaunch AFAM Concept in Ghana.
