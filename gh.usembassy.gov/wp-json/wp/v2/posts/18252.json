Jackson<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration (GIMPA)<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>November 29, 2017 | 10 a.m. &#8211; 12 p.m.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Good morning. I am so pleased to join you today in celebrating the official opening of this expanded YALI Regional Leadership Center facility. Thank you all for being here, as well. We are doing more than just opening a new building today. We are opening new opportunities for young leaders to transform West Africa.<\/p>\n<p>This facility is a tangible representation of America\u2019s long-term commitment to Ghana and to the region. We are proud to invest in the lives and the futures of your innovators, trailblazers and entrepreneurs. I know there are some YALI alumni in the audience today; could you please raise your hands?<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here. And I admire you for the responsibility that you have embraced \u2014 to help shape the future of this nation, this region, this continent \u2014 and the world, really.<\/p>\n<p>I also want to thank our distinguished partners at GIMPA, especially Professor P. Ebow Bondzi-Simpson. You have provided invaluable technical assistance in the design and rehabilitation of this building.<\/p>\n<p>From the start, YALI has sought to empower future leaders as they address the myriad issues confronting the world today.\u00a0 Issues like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Democracy and rule of law,<\/li>\n<li>Health.<\/li>\n<li>Climate change,<\/li>\n<li>Education,<\/li>\n<li>Global security,<\/li>\n<li>Trafficking,<\/li>\n<li>Gender issues,<\/li>\n<li>Corruption, and many more.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Through YALI, we convene the brightest young minds on the continent. We challenge them to take their leadership skills to the next level. I think we would all agree that we\u2019ve had remarkable success thus far. Alumni, would you agree?<\/p>\n<p>But we also know that the environment in which we learn \u2014 the quality of the equipment and the physical infrastructure \u2014 has a significant influence on learning outcomes. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so excited to inaugurate this facility.<\/p>\n<p>Just as YALI helps young leaders take their skills to the next level, we\u2019re now taking our own skills and abilities to the next level. We now have a well-equipped learning and communications environment that matches the prestige and the aspirations of the YALI program. This modern center will improve participants\u2019 experiences as they live and interact with each other during their training. It will strengthen the bonds between them and enhance their connections with other leaders and experts. It will help promote the YALI learning culture.<\/p>\n<p>Participants will even be able to use the Center\u2019s technology to connect with the RLCs in Dakar, Nairobi and Pretoria \u2014 what an extraordinary opportunity to develop best practices and promote continent-wide information sharing. I imagine our trainers and trainees are eager to move in and get to work.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve spent most of my career in Africa. I\u2019ve seen tremendous changes over the years \u2014 reductions in poverty, improvements in health, and the steady spread of democracy. Ghana is a wonderful example. It has cemented its reputation for free and fair elections and democratic transitions of power. Ghana has fostered a vibrant, free press and built a professional, widely respected military. The Akufo-Addo administration is working steadily to promote private sector growth and job creation. Mr. Minister, I applaud the steps you are taking to expand education for Ghanaians and to improve literacy at the primary levels.<\/p>\n<p>Like Africa as a whole, Ghana has changed and grown immensely since my first visit here in 1999. But I believe nothing will compare to the changes we will see in the coming generation. I read recently that the average age of an African head of state is 65 years old, and the average age of an African citizen is 19. This generation is coming into its own, and it is doing so with more access to information and technology than ever before.<\/p>\n<p>We still face formidable challenges, in Africa and around the world. But I believe this generation will use its connections, its creativity and its technology to address these issues in ways we can\u2019t even imagine right now. I believe they will see these challenges as opportunities, and that they will attack them with fresh perspectives and fresh energy. And so the question is: How do we best support them? How do we feed that enthusiasm to do more, to achieve more? This Center is one way. I want nothing more than for this Center \u2014 and the tools and training it offers \u2014 to inspire West Africa\u2019s movers and shakers. My goal is that it will be an environment that stimulates astonishing, world-changing ideas \u2014 and the courage to pursue them.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Minister, I thank you for your support of the Regional Leadership Center. Just as you are working to expand education for Ghanaians, this Center expands educational and leadership opportunities for Ghanaians and for your brothers and sisters throughout the region.<\/p>\n<p>To the RLC staff and partners, you have already changed and uplifted the lives of 2,000 of West Africa\u2019s highest achievers. That was just the beginning. I foresee even greater success ahead with the new tools at your disposal. I challenge you to continuously pursue the highest standards and the latest technologies. I challenge you to keep that passion alive for offering the best possible experience to our YALI RLC participants.<\/p>\n<p>To our alumni, please push each other \u2014 and push us \u2014 to be bold. Too many others are brazenly advancing a dark vision of the world. We must be bold and audacious and fearless in advancing the ideas that bring us together and positively resolve the challenges we face. I\u2019ve met many YALI participants over the years. I have faith in your ability to transform your communities. The United States has faith in your ability to transform our world. We\u2019re going to stand by you.<\/p>\n<p>Congratulations once again. This is an exciting, cutting-edge facility, and I look forward to visiting often to meet the inspiring young leaders who pass through.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On November 29, the United States and Ghana inaugurated a new building for the Young African Leaders Initiative Regional Leadership Center (YALI RLC) in Accra.
