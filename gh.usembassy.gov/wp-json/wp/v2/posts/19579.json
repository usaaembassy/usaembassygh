Representative in Ghana, Mr. Abdourahamane Diallo;<\/p>\n<p>Legendary journalist and teacher, Mr. Cameron Doudo;<\/p>\n<p>President of the Ghana Journalists Association (GJA), Mr. Affail Monney;<\/p>\n<p>Chairman of the National Media Commission, Mr. Yaw Boadu-Ayeboafoh;<\/p>\n<p>President of the Association of Women in the Media (ASWIM), Mrs. Mavis Kitcher;<\/p>\n<p>Members of the National Executive of the GJA;<\/p>\n<p>Members of Ghana\u2019s Police Band, thank you for your great performance!<\/p>\n<p>Distinguished ladies and gentlemen;<\/p>\n<p>It is an honor to be here today on behalf of Ambassador Stephanie Sullivan, who is traveling in Kumasi, to underscore once again America\u2019s commitment and belief as a core principle enshrined in our Constitution and Bill of Rights for freedom of the press.<\/p>\n<p>On the 26th anniversary of World Press Freedom Day, we renew our commitment to promoting and protecting a free press, which is an essential pillar of democracy.<\/p>\n<p>As Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said, and Ambassador Sullivan has reaffirmed here in Ghana, the United States values freedom of the press.\u00a0 This includes an independent media committed to responsible, facts-based journalism as a key component to promote democratic governance.<\/p>\n<p>By fostering a free press, citizens are more informed, active, and engaged in political decision-making, and can better hold their governments accountable.<\/p>\n<p>That is why the Embassy of the United States of America here in Ghana makes media outreach a priority.\u00a0 We are proud to open our doors to journalists to explain the positive results of our bilateral partnership programs to promote good governance, democracy, economic growth, and development in many sectors.\u00a0 We always invite journalists to contact us anytime they have questions.\u00a0 We also encourage you to follow the U.S. Embassy\u2019s social media platforms and website to stay informed and updated on our programs and activities.<\/p>\n<p>We are proud that the media often interviews Ghanaian partners and beneficiaries of our programs, who consistently tout the high quality of our partnerships to advance their professional objectives, as well as the shared values and goals between our nations.\u00a0 One of those goals is to promote Ghana\u2019s journey towards self-reliance.<\/p>\n<p>And the progress of that journey towards self-reliance and strengthening of your democratic institutions are often covered by journalists, as they should be.<\/p>\n<p>Journalism is a special vocation whose rewards are not always measured in salaries.\u00a0 Today, we honor the many journalists and media actors who have dedicated their lives, often at great risk, to promote transparency and accountability throughout the world. \u00a0They are unsung heroes.<\/p>\n<p>But we must remain vigilant.<\/p>\n<p>On January 18 this year, the U.S. Embassy condemned the murder of Ahmed Hussein-Suale, a young investigative journalist merely doing his job, and we called for a thorough investigation.\u00a0 We termed this not only an attack on Suale, but on Ghana\u2019s climate of transparency, democratic credibility, and press freedom.\u00a0 Further attacks on some journalists reflect a concerning trend which must be reversed to ensure Ghana\u2019s reputation for media freedoms is maintained.<\/p>\n<p>All nations which call themselves democracies must consistently promote freedom of the press, and a climate whereby journalists are free to do their work without fear, harassment, or intimidation.<\/p>\n<p>A free and independent media shines a light on challenges necessary for governments and citizens to tackle and strengthen our democracies on a range of issues, from good governance and transparency, to the need to combat corruption and human trafficking, and promote gender equality and human rights for all citizens without exception.\u00a0 Also to promote the protection of African natural resources and wildlife.<\/p>\n<p>There is no perfect nation, not even America or Ghana.\u00a0 But the media\u2019s work often points out imperfections which must be resolved to live up to the ideals of democracy.\u00a0 That\u2019s the difference in free societies such as ours, Ghana and the United States.<\/p>\n<p>We must always welcome that difference, and celebrate all journalists dedicated to defending these principles which protect our freedoms and liberties.<\/p>\n<p>As I said last year, I have been impressed by how vibrant and free public debates are on the radio and television, as well as in social media platforms here in Ghana.\u00a0 We commend Ghanaian journalists for giving citizens many forums to become active participants in the democratic process.<\/p>\n<p>We encourage you to keep expanding your network of contacts among other journalists gathered here today, and even to consider applying for one of our exchange programs in the United States.\u00a0 We also do journalism training quite regularly, where participants can meet fellow journalists who share their passion and commitment to tell the story.<\/p>\n<p>You are a key part of Ghana\u2019s story.\u00a0 Your work is very important to ensure Ghana continues to shine a light on this region and beyond as a model of democracy by remaining vigilant in protecting its traditions of freedom of the press. \u00a0The presence of my honorable and distinguished colleagues here today reaffirms this spirit.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, the theme for today\u2019s program is \u201cMedia for Democracy: Journalism and Elections in Times of Disinformation.\u201d\u00a0 How can journalists overcome this challenge?\u00a0 Censoring by governments of differing opinions must never be an option.\u00a0 Access to information is a right.<\/p>\n<p>Consider, however, that at no time in human history have people had greater access to information as they do today because of the internet.\u00a0 This is a great opportunity which cannot be reversed.\u00a0 You challenge disinformation by reporting the truth and calling on citizens to be better informed to strengthen our democracies.<\/p>\n<p>As journalists move forward in their work, they can count on the continued support of the United States of America.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you very much.<\/p>\n<p>May long live Ghana.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Remarks by Counselor for Public Affairs Roberto Quiroz II on World Press Freedom Day 2019 Ghana International Press Centre (GIPC) in
