That\u2019s where GRAF and these robotics competitions come to life.\u00a0They challenge students to apply what they\u2019ve learned to real life scenarios, while building the skills they will need in future careers.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. Embassy has supported GRAF and its mission almost from the start.\u00a0We believe in the potential of young Ghanaians to learn, apply, innovate, and succeed. We\u2019re living in a world driven by science and technology.\u00a0Even those of you who will not work directly in a STEM field in the future will need STEM-related knowledge and skills.<\/p>\n<p>Studies from around the world show that STEM fields will continue to offer increasing employment and career opportunities far into the future.\u00a0 So STEM is not just fun \u2013 like these competitions \u2013 it also can provide you a strong and successful career path.\u00a0I\u2019m happy to see girls represented among this year\u2019s winners \u2013 and I\u2019m especially proud to see women coaches of some of these teams.<\/p>\n<p>But we need more girls and women involved in STEM.\u00a0 And it can start with you \u2013 encouraging and inviting your female classmates to join your team or to compete against you.<\/p>\n<p>That might intensify the competition a bit, but it will also make you a stronger competitor.\u00a0 I also want to encourage all of you \u2013each of you who competed in robotics competitions this year \u2013 to become familiar with EducationUSA.<\/p>\n<p>EducationUSA is the U.S. Government\u2019s advising service for students who want to study in the United States.\u00a0We have many of the best STEM schools in the world.\u00a0I encourage all of you attend an EducationUSA information session to find out more about opportunities to study in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>You can find more about EducationUSA on the Embassy\u2019s website or by following us on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/USEmbassyGhana\">@ USEmbassyGhana<\/a>. I\u2019m excited to hear more about these projects and the competitions over the past year.\u00a0 I\u2019m even more excited to hear about what you do in the future and how you apply what you\u2019ve learned to change the world for the better.<\/p>\n<p>This reminds me of the adinkra symbol, \u201cNea Onnim No Sua A, Ohu,\u201d which means that\u00a0 \u201cHe who does not know, can know from learning.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for your kind attention.\u00a0 \u00a0Ayekoo \u2026 to everyone who competed this year!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ambassador Sullivan\u2019s Remarks at Ghana Robotics Academy Foundation\u2019s National Awards Ceremony January 22, 2022, 9:00 am \u00a0 Chairman of today\u2019s event, Reverend Kwesi Dickson; Professor Elsie Effah Kaufmann of the University of Ghana; Mr. Yaw Okraku-Yirenkyi and Mr. George Ollennu, Founding Members of the Ghana Robotics Academy Foundation; Mr. Julian Bennet of Academic City University &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1058,"featured_media":22231,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_gpalab_slo_mission_select":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[4,54],"tags":[7136,10012],"class_list":["post-22229","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-ambassador","category-speeches","tag-ambassador-sullivan","tag-ghana-robotics-academy"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) -
