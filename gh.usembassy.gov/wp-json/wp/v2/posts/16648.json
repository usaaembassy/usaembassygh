The \u201cGood Life, Live It Well\u201d campaign will serve as the overarching Ghana Health Service brand and will promote positive health behaviors through television, radio, social media, and print materials. President John Dramani Mahama, U.S. Ambassador Robert P. Jackson, government of Ghana officials, and members of the public were present at the launch event.<\/p>\n<p>The \u201cGood Life, Live it Well\u201d campaign was first launched in partnership with USAID in 2010. The new, refreshed campaign will promote improved health behaviors in family planning; maternal, newborn and child health; malaria prevention and treatment; and water, sanitation and hygiene. USAID is providing $10 million towards the mass media and print campaigns, as well as technical support in the development of the campaign\u2019s messages.<\/p>\n<p>By focusing on the health behaviors involved in each stage of life, the refreshed campaign will resonate with Ghanaians from all walks of life and encourage them to adopt healthy behaviors,\u201d said Ambassador Jackson at the launch event. \u201cA healthy population is one of the most important enablers of economic growth. Healthy children are attentive students. They grow into healthy, educated adults who can create and fill the jobs that will propel the Ghanaian economy forward.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The \u201cGood Life, Live It Well\u201d campaign furthers the goals of USAID\u2019s integrated Health, Population, and Nutrition Program, which works to improve the health and well-being of the population in Ghana. USAID partners with the government of Ghana to achieve these goals, build leadership, improve governance, and build capacity in the health sector.<\/p>\n<p class=\"heading2_h2\">About USAID<\/p>\n<p>USAID is the lead U.S. government agency that works to end extreme global poverty and enable resilient, democratic societies to realize their potential.
