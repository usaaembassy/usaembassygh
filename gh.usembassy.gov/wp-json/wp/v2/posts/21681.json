The Special Envoy will play a vital role in leading implementation of the Presidential Memorandum on Advancing the Human Rights of LGBTQI+ Persons Around the World. At a time when the human rights of LGBTQI+ persons are increasingly threatened in all regions of the world, the Special Envoy will bring together like-minded governments, civil society organizations, corporations, and international organizations to uphold dignity and equality for all.<\/p>\n<p>On Friday, President Biden said, quote: \u201cFor this community and for our nation and for the world, Pride Month represents so much.\u00a0 It stands for courage \u2013 the courage of all those in previous generations and today who proudly live their truth.\u00a0 It stands for justice: both the steps we\u2019ve taken and the steps we need to take.\u00a0And above all, Pride Month stands for love \u2013 being able to love yourself, and love whomever you love, and love this country enough to make it more fair, and more free, and more just.\u201d End quote.<\/p>\n<p>This year has been challenging for Ghana\u2019s LGBTQI+ community.\u00a0 From the shuttering of the LGBTQI+ Advocacy Center in Accra, the arrests of 22 friends gathered in the Eastern Region, talk of an anti-LGBTQI+ bill, and most recently, the arrest and lengthy pre-bail detention of 21 human rights defenders in Ho, the community is facing increased anti-LGBTQI+ rhetoric and actions.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you to Shone Edem Lawrence for speaking so passionately on behalf of the community here in Ghana.\u00a0 I had the honor of speaking with Shone and a couple of members of the Ho 21 prior to this event.\u00a0 I will tell you what I told them: the U.S. government is an ally of the LGBTQI+ community in Ghana.\u00a0 During my tenure as U.S. Ambassador to Ghana and especially this past year, I\u2019ve made it a priority to urge national leaders in Ghana to uphold constitutional human rights protections and to adhere to international human rights obligations and commitments for all individuals.\u00a0 This especially includes the people in this room.\u00a0 While many of these conversations are conducted behind closed doors, know that I, and other members of the diplomatic community here this evening and also those not present, are advocates for you to be accorded your constitutional human rights.<\/p>\n<p>This year\u2019s celebration is a bit low key.\u00a0 With the pandemic ever present and the current sensitivities surrounding the human rights of LGBTQI+ persons in Ghana, many may have wondered whether a diplomatic mission Pride event should occur.\u00a0 Our answer at the U.S. Embassy is a resounding yes. It\u2019s the policy of the United States to pursue an end to violence and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.\u00a0Therefore, it is important to take the time to gather, take stock, and reaffirm our determination to continue to promote the human rights of the community, with the community.<\/p>\n<p>Just as senior officials raised the Progress Flag for the first time at the State Department last Friday, I\u2019m happy to invite you all to watch as we hoist the Pride flag in honor of the people we celebrate this month and as a symbol of our continued commitment to the human rights, dignity, and inclusion of all LGBTQI+ people.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Pride Reception 2021: \u201cYou are Included\u201d As Prepared Remarks for U.S. Ambassador to Ghana Stephanie S.
