Ghana \u2013 Ghanaian students continue to choose the United States as a top destination for higher education. \u00a0The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.opendoorsdata.org\">2022 Open Doors Report<\/a> released today confirms that 4,916 Ghanaian students studied at U.S. colleges and universities during the most recent (2021-2022) academic year.\u00a0 This represents a 16 percent increase over the previous year and continues a long-term growth trend among Ghanaian students.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cU.S. higher educational institutions offer world-class learning experiences.\u00a0 Our team has worked hard to help students with the application, admission, and visa process this year.\u00a0 We are so proud that more Ghanaian students are choosing the United States,\u201d said U.S. Ambassador to Ghana Virginia Palmer.<\/p>\n<p>Ghanaian students studied at 700 U.S. colleges and universities in all 50 U.S. states in 2021-2022. \u00a0Among Sub-Saharan African countries, Ghana sends the second-highest number of students (second only to Nigeria).\u00a0 Ghana also now ranks 18<sup>th<\/sup> in the world for countries sending students to the United States for graduate programs.<\/p>\n<p>Following the COVID-19 pandemic, new international student enrollment in the United States rebounded this year \u2013 the total number of international students enrolled in U.S. institutions increased four percent.\u00a0 The United States remains the top destination for international education with over 948,000 students enrolled.<\/p>\n<p>Ghanaian student Philip De-Graft, a freshman at Stetson University in DeLand, Florida, is a member of the school\u2019s Presidential and Bonner Scholar programs.\u00a0 Philip is the first person in his family to attend university.\u00a0 \u201cEducationUSA provided me with reliable information and helped me to select my best fit institution. \u00a0From test preparation to essay review, to the visa process and pre-departure orientation, we had a great relationship.\u00a0 Even after helping me land a full scholarship, EducationUSA\u2019s Opportunity Fund Program helped me pay for the application fee and travel costs,\u201d noted Philip in a conversation with EducationUSA.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_22957\" aria-labelledby=\"figcaption_attachment_22957\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 432px\"><img loading=\"lazy\"
