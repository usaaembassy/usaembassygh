\u2026 Because she was no spring chicken!<\/li>\n<li>What do you call a chicken with lettuce in its eye? \u2026 Chicken Sees a Salad!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I\u2019m really pleased to be with you here at the Labadi Beach Hotel as we celebrate what I know will be a culinary experience to remember.\u00a0 Tonight\u2019s gala recognizes the efforts of some very talented young people whose interest in the culinary arts brought them to this two-day workshop and today\u2019s competition.<\/p>\n<p>Before we go any further, though, just a quick note about my speech.\u00a0 I was told when I accepted this invitation that my remarks are supposed to be full of chicken-and-egg humor.\u00a0 So as I continue, I only ask that you be patient with my attempts at jokes.\u00a0 I\u2019m kind of an introverted person by nature, and this is forcing me to come out of my shell.<\/p>\n<p>But I\u2019m truly very <em>egg<\/em>-cited to be here, and I promise to be brief because I want, as much as you do, to be able to enjoy the tasty dishes the competitors have prepared for us.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. Embassy is pleased to support the U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council as they lead today\u2019s activities. \u00a0USAPEEC has been working with Ghana\u2019s Technical University students for four years, specifically by educating third-year students about the high quality, versatility, and affordability of U.S. poultry products.\u00a0 And we\u2019re honored that chef David Bonom traveled to Ghana from New York to coach and mentor these students on culinary techniques and creativity. \u00a0But I have a question for Chef David\u2026 Between the techniques and the creativity, Which came first?<\/p>\n<p>This biennial event and training program is yet another example of the strong bilateral cooperation that exists between the United States and Ghana in the agricultural sector \u2026 It truly is <em>egg<\/em>-stensive.\u00a0 We recognize the tremendous importance of strengthening our economic and trade ties, as well as the significance of programs like this that will increase local interest in the culinary sector and develop the next generation of Ghanaian chefs and agricultural leaders.<\/p>\n<p>This evening\u2019s gala complements the U.S. Embassy\u2019s long commitment to building the capacity of the local poultry sector, and I\u2019d like to take a minute or two to touch on some of our key programs for those of you who may not be fully abreast of what we\u2019re doing.<\/p>\n<p>Through the Food for Progress program, the U.S. Government has invested $58 million in helping the sector become ever more vibrant and viable.\u00a0 Specifically, we\u2019ve done this through the Ghana Poultry Project and the \u201cAssisting Management in the Poultry and Layer Industries by Feed Improvement and Efficiency Strategies\u201d program, or AMPLIFIES.\u00a0 These efforts are helping to transform farm operations and increase outputs in Ghana\u2019s major poultry-producing regions.<\/p>\n<p>And just a personal note about the AMPLIFIES program\u2026\u00a0 Tonight is actually my second AMPLIFIES cookoff.\u00a0 Back in April, I had the opportunity to represent the U.S. Embassy at the Tortsogbeza festival in the Volta Region, and the AMPLIFIES team was there in force, touting the many health benefits of eggs while dispelling misinformation about their downsides.\u00a0 AMPLIFIES sponsored a cooking competition at the durbar grounds in which local cooks were challenged to integrate eggs into traditional dishes that normally wouldn\u2019t have them.\u00a0 Some of the resulting culinary creations included eggs in Jollof rice, eggs in <em>kontomire<\/em>, and even eggs in <em>nkate nkwan<\/em>!<\/p>\n<p>At that same event, AMPLIFIES handed out over 2,000 invidividually-wrapped hard-boiled eggs to the crowd as snacks.\u00a0 Ever since that day, I\u2019ve come to think of the host town of Sekpoe as S<em>egg<\/em>-poe!<\/p>\n<p>But coming back to this evening\u2019s festivities\u2026 I know that, like me, you\u2019re all very excited to find out who will be crowned the champion of this year\u2019s American Chicken Cooking Competition.<\/p>\n<p>Okay, so maybe that one was pushing it a little.\u00a0 But you\u2019re not here to listen to me tell bad jokes anyway, but to celebrate these fine young budding chefs and to savor the wonderful meal they\u2019ve created for us.\u00a0 So I\u2019ll just end by offering my sincere admiration and congratulations to all of the students and institutions that participated.<\/p>\n<p>Ay-egg-koo!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>USA Poultry National Chicken Cooking Competition U.S. Embassy Accra Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires Christopher J.
