Aggrey, \u201cThe surest way to keep people down is to educate the men and neglect the women. If you educate a man you simply educate an individual, but if you educate a woman, you educate a family.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The United States is proud to promote academic exchanges and education programs as an investment in Ghana\u2019s future.\u00a0 We are also proud that the United States remains the nation of choice for Ghanaian youth to study abroad.\u00a0 That is why I want to invite Ghanaian youth to consider applying to study in the United States.\u00a0 That is why there are vigorous academic partnerships between our academic institutions, which we want to expand further through the University Partnership Initiative of the U.S. Department of State.<\/p>\n<p>We want to welcome more Ghanaian youth to study at one of our institutions and then come back home to contribute to Ghana\u2019s development in agriculture, academia, business, government, film, music, and whatever field their talents take them.<\/p>\n<p>I have good news on this.\u00a0 The recently released 2019 Open Doors Report on international education showed an overall 14% increase over 2018 in the number of Ghanaian students attending universities and colleges in the United States, to 3,661 from 3,213.\u00a0 This brings Ghana into second place in Sub-Saharan Africa, a spot previously held by Kenya.\u00a0 The number one spot is held by Nigeria, with 13,423 students.\u00a0 We believe that in two years we can increase the number of Ghanaians studying in U.S. campuses to over 5,000.<\/p>\n<p>On the other side, we are also pleased to see that Ghana experienced an increase in the number of American students participating in study abroad programs in Ghana to 2,210 from 1,865. This makes Ghana the second most popular destination in Sub-Saharan Africa for American exchange students, only after South Africa. These statistics demonstrate that exchanges between our citizens are successfully expanding mutual understanding and strengthening the ties between our nations.\u00a0 American and Ghanaian youth share aspirations to connect with one another to build a future of peace and prosperity for us all.<\/p>\n<p>When we speak of youth leadership, we also should raise awareness on the importance of mentorship.\u00a0 I encourage Ghanaian youth to identify mentors to give them the guidance that they need to succeed.\u00a0 Every person needs support, encouragement, and at times some direct talk to attain success.\u00a0 I also urge women to mentor one another more. \u00a0When we champion and mentor girls, we are investing in their future and the future of our communities, nations, and world. \u00a0It takes just a little time to make a major difference in a young man and woman\u2019s life.<\/p>\n<p>I encourage Ghanaian youth to identify your talents and display resiliency on your journey to success, whatever your goal. To cite an African saying that goes against the grain of the more commonly encountered attitude of \u201cwait your turn,\u201d \u201cWhen the youth beat the drums, the elders can also dance.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Remember Ashitey Trebi-Ollennu, a son of Ghana.\u00a0 As a young boy, he grew up close to Kotoka airport in Accra and dreamt of far away places as he saw airplanes taking off every day.\u00a0\u00a0 He pursued his dreams and is now a robotics engineer at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), in addition to the chief engineer and technical group leader for the mobility and manipulation group at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.<\/p>\n<p>He has been associated with various NASA Mars missions, notably the Mars Rover and InSight projects.\u00a0 Because he pursued an education and followed his dreams, humanity now has a better understanding of the planet Mars, as well as robotics breakthroughs useful for applications closer to home here on Earth!<\/p>\n<p>Somewhere in Ghana today is a young person who may one day invent new technologies that will revolutionize digital communications, or become the CEO of an agricultural company that will modernize this key sector and position Ghana to nourish itself and become a major exporter of food across Africa, thereby generating needed jobs, income, and food security.\u00a0 Somewhere out there is a future President of the Republic of Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to the Millennium Excellence Foundation for encouraging these youth today.\u00a0 I am confident they will contribute to an ever-more prosperous Ghana, which is both good for Ghana and good for the United States.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ambassador Stephanie Sullivan\u2019s Remarks at the President\u2019s Outstanding Youth Prize Hosted by the Board of the Millennium Excellence Foundation Labadi Beach Hotel, Labadi Suite, Accra, Ghana Sunday, December 15, 2019; 4:00 p.m. \u00a0 Founder of the Millennium Excellence Foundation, Ashim Morton; Governor Board Member of the Millennium Excellence Foundation, Sapna Mukhi; Other Members of the &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1058,"featured_media":20282,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_gpalab_slo_mission_select":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[4,54],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-20284","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-ambassador","category-speeches"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) -
