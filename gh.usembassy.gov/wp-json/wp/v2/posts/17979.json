Jackson has said, we consider it a priority to partner with Ghanaians whose efforts empower youth, women, and girls to promote development through their own immense talents and contributions.\u00a0We live in an interconnected world; when you prosper the region and Ghana prosper, and the world and the United States also prosper and benefit from your success.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In her remarks, the Honorable Abla Dzifa Gomashie thanked the U.S. for its support, lauded the program\u2019s resource staff for mentoring and motivating the participants, and exhorted them to remember that \u201cthere is no excuse for failure,\u201d and that they must persevere through attaining an education and developing their fullest potential.\u00a0She also noted that one of the program\u2019s key goals was to offer the youth the potential to establish their own businesses and work independently. \u201cIncome generation from your own talents has the power to economically sustain your families and communities\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Quiroz and the U.S. Embassy team then visited the Ho Technical University.

We urge all of them to show that America passed through them, not that they passed through America, and look forward to strengthening our fruitful cooperation with them and the U.S. Embassy,\u201d he said. Mr. Quiroz, Ms. Bosompem, and 2015 Mandela Washington Fellow Bright Dey then conducted an interview with the university\u2019s radio station journalist Herbert Mawuli Yevu-Agbi to discuss the 2018 MWF program\u2019s application process, Education USA services, and consular services.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. Embassy team then hosted a dinner for Young African Leaders Initiative\/Mandela Washington Fellows (YALI\/MWF) alumni Dr. Mary Ashinyo, Medical Director at the Volta Regional Hospital, 2015 MWF; Alfred Godwin Adjabeng, Chief Executive Officer of the Reach out to Future Leaders Movement, 2015 MWF; and Bright Dey, Regional Head of Information Technology at the Ghana Education Service in the Volta Region, 2015 MWF.\u00a0They also welcomed former Deputy Minister Gomashie and her husband Brigadier General Martin Ahiaglo (retired, Army of Ghana), who is also an alumnus of the U.S. National War College in Washington, D.C.<\/p>\n<p>The MWF alumni discussed their ongoing efforts to promote growth in the academic, medical, and agricultural sectors by bringing together young professionals in their fields to create new opportunities for Ghanaian youth, especially women and girls.\u00a0\u201cThe high numbers of youth entering workforce age each year signal a need for our country. We believe that with Ghana\u2019s growing youth population, we have a responsibility to help create the conditions where job creation in key sectors flourish to welcome them and their talents to the job market,\u201d said Alfred Godwin Adjabeng.<\/p>\n<p>Former Deputy Minister Gomashie congratulated the youth and urged them to hold on to the power of positive thinking, adding: \u201cRemain focused and don\u2019t allow negative energy to demotivate you from your goals.\u00a0Anything is possible with a positive mind frame and commitment when you embark on a journey of servant leadership to uplift others who can benefit from the good fortunes of your experiences.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. Embassy\u2019s visit to the Volta Region is part of our public outreach to strengthen partnerships with all Ghanaians and with alumni of U.S. government exchange programs sponsored by the American people.<\/p>\n<p>To learn more about the YALI\/MWF program please see:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/yali.state.gov\/washington-fellowship\/\">https:\/\/yali.state.gov\/washington-fellowship\/<\/a>; to learn more about CCI please see:<a href=\"https:\/\/exchanges.state.gov\/non-us\/program\/community-college-initiative-program\">https:\/\/exchanges.state.gov\/non-us\/program\/community-college-initiative-program<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>From September 15 through 16, U.S. Embassy Public Affairs Officer Roberto Quiroz II, Cultural Affairs Specialist Sophia A.
