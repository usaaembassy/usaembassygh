NASTAG is a partnership between producers, traders, government institutions and processors in the seed industry. The Association aims to spur private sector investment and promote the use of high-quality certified seed. In attendance were, USAID\/Ghana Agriculture Team Leader Jenna Tajchman and Deputy Minister of Agriculture Honorable Dr. Sagre Bambangi, who highlighted the importance of growing Ghana\u2019s seed industry to build a food secure future.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At the event, seven new Executive Council Members of the Association were inducted into office to grow the competitiveness of Ghana\u2019s seed industry. The Executive Council will work to strengthen the business and technical skills of its members, promote collaboration between seed value chain actors, and advocate on regulations, standardization and the provision of general seed information to all stakeholders.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" style=\"width: 522px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/175\/Seed-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"341\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Deputy Minister of Agriculture Honorable Dr. Sagre Bambangi delivers remarks at the launch of the National Seed Trade Association of Ghana, created to increase the quantity and quality of seed distribution in Ghana.
