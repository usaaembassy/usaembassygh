USAID&#8217;s support extends to strengthening the capacity of local and traditional authorities and citizens, fostering resilience and social cohesion, and encouraging locally-led solutions to conflict and violence prevention. With USAID support, the Northern Regional Peace Council has collaboratively worked with the Dagbon Traditional Council to revise the Dagbon constitution from 1930, fortifying traditional governance and providing a roadmap for chieftaincy succession in the Dagbon Traditional Area.<\/p>\n<p># # #<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>About USAID<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is the lead U.S. Government agency that works to end extreme global poverty and enable resilient, democratic societies to realize their potential.\u00a0 USAID&#8217;s activities and strategic partnerships support Ghana&#8217;s journey to self-reliance.
