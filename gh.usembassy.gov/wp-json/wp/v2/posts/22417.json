And tomorrow marks 65 years of the U.S. Ghana relationship as well! I am so pleased to be a part of this event again.\u00a0 Mentoring is important for everyone \u2013 for young people, for people seeking to advance in their careers, for students, for parents, but especially for women and communities too often excluded from opportunities and leadership.<\/p>\n<p>Because we haven\u2019t yet achieved full equality for women in society, education, and careers, we need to be there to help each other.<\/p>\n<p>I have a few thoughts about mentoring, and I hope you will take them to heart:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>As you succeed, remember to lift others up to succeed in their own journeys. Our mentors here today have already embraced this, but now it will be up to mentees to look for opportunities to support somebody else. Others mentored me, and you\u2019ve already had life experiences you can harness to help others.<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>Learn from setbacks. It is rarely a straight line to the top. \u00a0There will be many stumbles and falls along the way, and it is at those points when mentorship is crucial in righting the path.\u00a0 It\u2019s important to be honest as a mentor \u2013 talk about your own setbacks and how they contributed to your personal and professional growth. I finally passed the Foreign Service exam on my third try!\u00a0 It turned out to be a test of persistence. They say it took Thomas Edison 1,000 tries before he invented the lightbulb\u2026where would we be if he had given up after 999 tries?<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>I encourage you all to be open to serendipity. Sometimes the path you initially set out on doesn\u2019t work out. But that\u2019s okay because something else \u2013 perhaps something completely unexpected \u2013 will surely come along. \u00a0After university, my Plan A was to study at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. I didn\u2019t make it all the way to the finals, and instead joined the Peace Corps as a teacher in the now DRC.\u00a0 I taught at a girls\u2019 boarding school outside the capital. While there I met a diplomat for the first time and decided I would like to pursue diplomacy as a career. This happened through serendipity, because of Plan B!<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>Don\u2019t compare yourself to others. You can find inspiration from role models, but don\u2019t beat yourself up with comparisons.\u00a0 It is tempting to worry that you are falling behind somehow or less talented than others. \u00a0Remember, there is no one-size-fits-all. \u00a0Don\u2019t be bothered by pressure from family or friends to adhere to a timeline that doesn\u2019t work for you. \u00a0Focus on what you bring to the conversation and being the best you that you can be!\u00a0 Be authentic. Nobody can be you as well as you can. Everybody has their own timetable. \u00a0I got \u201cstuck\u201d at a certain rank while my peers were promoted ahead of me. \u00a0But I was building up valuable experience that came in handy later, and look at me now, a Career Minister, the equivalent of a three-star general!<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>Be kind to others along the way; you never know when you\u2019ll come across them again.\u00a0 It matters how we treat people from all walks of life.\u00a0 This becomes especially true when we reach positions of leadership and become responsible for setting the tone for organizations and more junior colleagues.\u00a0 For example, I was a little grumpy with my team this morning but I apologized to them, and will try to be better.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>And finally, for today\u2019s leaders, don\u2019t stop at mentoring.\u00a0 It is important that we also seek out those young women you can sponsor &#8211; advocate for to ensure that they are noticed, put \u201con the radar,\u201d breakthrough the traditional barriers, and advance into positions of leadership.\u00a0 Recognize that we as mentors also have a lot to learn from our mentees. \u00a0They can offer a fresh perspective on our challenges, including with multiple generations in the workplace, not to mention they are usually better at technology.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not enough to be the first woman in a specific job or position \u2013 we also need to support and advocate the next generation so that we\u2019re not the only woman ever in a specific job or position, instead that we were just the first of many women there.<\/p>\n<p>Women\u2019s empowerment is an important part of what we do at the U.S. Embassy and we are happy to support this program again this year.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m pleased that our program, the Academy for Women Entrepreneurs has trained more than 160 Ghanaian women on how to manage and grow their businesses.\u00a0 And mentoring has been a critical part of that program. \u00a0We will be opening applications for our next cohort very soon.<\/p>\n<p>We will also be hosting a Women\u2019s Empowerment Lab later this month to help Ghanaian and American women entrepreneurs connect, develop relationships, and take advantage of export opportunities to the United States and to Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>With the release of the first-ever U.S. National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality, the Biden-Harris Administration reaffirmed that advancing the rights of women and girls is both a moral and strategic imperative. \u00a0It\u2019s nice to know that the Biden-Harris Administration includes the first female vice president of the United States, isn\u2019t it? And \u2026 I don\u2019t think she will be the last.<\/p>\n<p>In every country, including Ghana, women and girls experience challenges, impeding their full and meaningful participation, keeping their societies from reaching their full potential.<\/p>\n<p>Gender equity and equality is not only a human rights issue \u2013 it is critical to free and fair democracy, inclusive economic growth, international peace and stability, preventing and responding to gender-based violence, and more effectively addressing global challenges such as the climate crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>Our world needs all voices to meet the challenges of today.\u00a0 We simply cannot afford to leave anyone out.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for women to mentor each other.\u00a0 I look forward to seeing today\u2019s mentees become mentors themselves, do amazing things as leaders in our communities, and help each other maximize our potential.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for your kind attention.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ambassador Stephanie Sullivan\u2019s Remarks Vital Voices Global Mentoring Walk March 5, 2022 10:30am -As Delivered- &nbsp; Executive Director Brigitte Dzogbenuku; Sponsors; Supporters; Mentors and Mentees; Walkers; Ladies and Gentlemen; Our fabulous MC; All protocols observed: Good morning!
