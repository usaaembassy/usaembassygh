><\/div><p class=\"paragraph\">Honorable Minister,<br \/>\nYour Eminence Archbishop Duncan-Williams,<br \/>\nBishops,<br \/>\nColleagues,<br \/>\nDistinguished Ladies and Gentlemen,<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">Thank you and good morning.\u00a0 A little over a week ago, I joined Minister of Employment and Labor Relations Haruna Iddrisu for a tour of Dignity\u2013Do The Right Thing, a U.S.-Ghanaian joint venture textile company operating in the South Industrial Area, right here in Accra.\u00a0 It was there where I met Salma Salifu, the Managing Director of the company.\u00a0 Salma is here with us today.\u00a0 Salma, can you please stand and be recognized?<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">Dignity\u2013DTRT is now the largest Ghanaian exporter of apparel, shipping goods worth approximately $1 million a month to the United States.\u00a0 Salma employs approximately 1,500 workers, primarily women.\u00a0 She has new orders coming in from the United States and plans to hire an additional 500 operators and trainers by the end of this year.\u00a0 If her company can secure additional space, she intends to hire another 1,000 employees by the end of 2017.\u00a0 Salma and Dignity\u2013DTRT are examples of the good things the United States and Ghana can do together.\u00a0 I want to see more of these success stories during my tenure as Ambassador.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">I want to significantly deepen the commercial engagement between the United States and Ghana.\u00a0 Our current level of bilateral trade stands at $1.2 billion, heavily in favor of the United States.\u00a0 My goal is to see that number double over the next three years.\u00a0 Of course, I hope to see Ghana open its doors to an increased number of American products and services.\u00a0 But I also want to see Ghana transform its manufacturing sector and send an increased amount of \u201cMade in Ghana\u201d exports to the U.S. market.\u00a0 There are enough opportunities through bilateral trade to create jobs and benefit both our economies.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">How do we double that bilateral trade number?\u00a0 It is an achievable goal, but it will require three things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"paragraph\">First, it will require hard work, commitment, and follow-through from our governments.<\/li>\n<li class=\"paragraph\">Second, all stakeholders\u2014American and Ghanaian\u2014must address some tough and sensitive issues and take a stand to do what is right, even in the midst of opposition from vested interest groups.<\/li>\n<li class=\"paragraph\">And finally, we need the private sector to embrace the entrepreneurial spirit and push for needed reforms and more business-friendly policies.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"paragraph\"><strong>U.S. Government Commitment To Ghana<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">The U.S. government is committed to promoting U.S. trade with\u2014and investment in\u2014Ghana, and all of Africa.\u00a0 Allow me to share a few examples of the growing trade ties we have witnessed under President Obama\u2019s leadership.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">U.S. Department of Commerce:\u00a0 Our U.S. Department of Commerce has expanded its operations in Accra in recent years to facilitate U.S. business activity.\u00a0 It has supported 79 private sector deals over the past year worth approximately $800 million.\u00a0 Last September, eight U.S. companies visited Ghana to explore opportunities to partner with Ghanaian companies.\u00a0 This was part of the Commerce Department\u2019s Trade Winds \u2013 Africa program, the largest-ever U.S. government-led trade mission to Africa.\u00a0 In total, the mission brought to the continent more than 100 companies from 25 U.S. states and across industry sectors.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">More recently, the Department of Commerce brought 25 U.S. universities to Ghana, seeking to strengthen our cooperation in higher education.\u00a0 Already more than one dozen Ghanaian students have taken advantage of that particular opportunity to meet U.S. schools and will start their university careers in the United States this fall.\u00a0 These deals and trade missions have created jobs for both Americans and Ghanaians.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">Millennium Challenge Corporation:\u00a0 Before the end of July, we anticipate that Ghana\u2019s long-awaited second Millennium Challenge Corporation Compact will finally enter into force.\u00a0 The citizens of Ghana will benefit from nearly $500 million in assistance, designed to strengthen the power sector by creating an enabling environment for investment and improving the performance and creditworthiness of Ghana\u2019s electrical utilities.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">I know what you may have heard, and let me be perfectly clear: this is NOT a privatization of the Electricity Company of Ghana.\u00a0 ECG will continue to be a public utility owned <i>by<\/i> the people of Ghana and operated <i>for <\/i>the people of Ghana.\u00a0 Under the MCC program, a private sector operator with innovative ideas and capital will help improve the operational and financial performance of the power provider.\u00a0 This private sector investment in the network will make ECG profitable once again and capable of providing quality service to its clients.\u00a0 I don\u2019t have to tell you how critical a consistent and reliable source of energy is to the economic development of Ghana and the success of the Ghanaian businesses in this room today.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">U.S. Department of Agriculture:\u00a0 Our U.S. Department of Agriculture team is working to improve food security and increase farmers\u2019 incomes.\u00a0 There is a widening gap in our bilateral trade relationship for food and agricultural products.\u00a0 Ghana is the clear leader, outpacing the United States by $170 million in 2015.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">Last year, Ghana\u2019s food and agricultural exports to the United States reached $260 million.\u00a0 This 8 percent increase was dominated by U.S. purchases of Ghanaian cocoa beans and processed cocoa products.\u00a0 We also saw record sales in other consumer-oriented products, such as vegetable oils, snack foods, processed fruits and vegetables, and spices.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, U.S. agricultural exports to Ghana fell to $90 million, a noticeable decline of 40 percent from 2014.\u00a0 Based on statistics to date in 2016, this trade gap is expected to continue.\u00a0 Last November, Deputy Secretary of Agriculture Krysta Harden led a trade mission of 19 U.S. food and agricultural exporters to Ghana to explore potential business partnerships.\u00a0 On that same trip, the Deputy Secretary announced that the U.S. government will contribute $58 million over the next five years to revitalize and support a sustainable Ghanaian poultry industry.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\"><strong>AGOA:<\/strong>\u00a0 The African Growth and Opportunity Act was signed into law in 2000 and is the cornerstone of the U.S.-Africa trade relationship.\u00a0 Last summer, the U.S. Congress voted to renew AGOA for another ten years.\u00a0 This is the longest extension in the program\u2019s history, and it sends a strong signal that the United States is serious about expanding our trade relationship with Africa.\u00a0 The extension provides certainty for Ghanaian producers and U.S. buyers regarding access to the U.S. market.\u00a0 It creates a stable environment that encourages increased investment in Ghana.\u00a0 With the support of USAID\u2019s West Africa Trade and Investment Hub, we are already seeing positive signs of progress in key employment-intensive sectors.\u00a0 Let\u2019s look again at the apparel industry, for example: Apparel exports to the United States have increased tenfold from 2010 through 2015.\u00a0 In the agricultural sector, not only have we seen substantial growth in traditional exports such as cocoa and cashews over the last five years, we also see growing trade in products such as yams.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">However, we still need more Ghanaian companies to take advantage of this program.\u00a0 We have partnered with the Ghana Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) to launch an AGOA Trade Resource Center, designed to support companies as they seize the opportunities provided by AGOA.\u00a0 GCCI and the American Chamber of Commerce joined forces on an AGOA outreach event last month, and we are planning a series of events targeted to the needs of exporters over the coming year.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">USAID Trade Africa.\u00a0 We are encouraging the Ghanaian government to take advantage of the WTO\u2019s Trade Facilitation Agreement.\u00a0 The TFA will simplify customs and border control procedures and reduce the cost and time of doing business across borders.\u00a0 TFA implementation would help in three ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"paragraph\">Ghanaian businesses could participate more fully in global value chains;<\/li>\n<li class=\"paragraph\">It would smooth the movement of goods across regional borders; and<\/li>\n<li class=\"paragraph\">And finally, it would make Ghanaian goods more competitive in global markets.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">This would have broad development benefits and would promote regional integration, investment, and exports.\u00a0 The OECD estimates that implementing the TFA could reduce worldwide trade costs by as much as 17.5 percent, with the greatest benefits accruing to African and other developing countries.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">In 2013, President Obama announced a new Trade Africa Initiative.\u00a0 Under this initiative, USAID is working to strengthen two-way trade, as well as intra-regional trade.\u00a0 In Ghana, this $10 million effort will support trade facilitation; strengthen sanitary and phytosanitary compliance with agricultural products; support Ghana\u2019s ability to meet international standards and guidelines; and promote regional trade and investment.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">U.S. Department of Transportation\/International Port Security Inspections:\u00a0 Nearly one year ago, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx visited Ghana.\u00a0 On that trip, he signed a Declaration of Intent to expand the \u201cSafe Skies for Africa\u201d program.\u00a0 That expansion includes the transfer of U.S. Federal Aviation Administration safety and security courses to the Ghana Civil Aviation Training Academy. \u00a0This enables Ghanaians to provide training to Ghanaians and other members of the Banjul Accord Group Aviation Safety Oversight Organization.\u00a0 American partnership in this area is a step toward promoting the aviation security that is essential for Ghanaian businesses and regional and international trade to flourish.\u00a0 Likewise, the U.S. Coast Guard International Ship and Port Security inspection teams work closely with the Ghana Ministry of Transportation, the Ghana Maritime Authority, and the Ghana Ports and Harbor Authority to share port security best practices.\u00a0 Ensuring a stable port security system will also foster increased trade for \u201cMade in Ghana\u201d exports to the United States and other places around the world.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\"><strong>OPIC\/EXIM\/USTDA:<\/strong>\u00a0 And finally, U.S. agencies such as the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA), and the U.S. Export-Import Bank (ExImBank) are also working to provide financing and insurance for projects related to Ghana\u2019s energy sector and for the rehabilitation of Ridge Hospital here in Accra.\u00a0 In fact, OPIC\u2019s largest portfolio in the world consists of investments in Ghana.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\"><strong>Addressing Tough and Sensitive Issues That Hinder Trade\/Investment<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">As you can see, the United States is heavily invested in Ghana.\u00a0 There is so much opportunity.\u00a0 Every week, I meet with American companies interested in establishing operations here and developing business relationships with potential Ghanaian partners.\u00a0 I also meet with Ghanaian business leaders who have visions of expanding their domestic operations.\u00a0 While there is much business and trade interest in Ghana, there are also many concerns and challenges that must be addressed.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">Foremost among these are Ghana\u2019s macroeconomic stability, a reliable energy sector, and access to affordable credit.\u00a0 The Government of Ghana is to be commended on the positive steps it has taken over the past year to steer the country\u2019s macroeconomic trajectory back on track under the ongoing IMF program.\u00a0 Tough decisions were made. \u00a0More difficult steps\u2014including some that may be politically unpopular\u2014will need to be taken in the weeks and months ahead.\u00a0 We encourage the government to remain steadfast in its commitment to the IMF program, especially in its efforts to address the debt and arrears owed to the various state-owned enterprises, particularly in the power sector.\u00a0 Under our ongoing bilateral Partnership For Growth Initiative, the United States will continue to work with our Ghanaian counterparts to address issues related to Ghana\u2019s power sector and access to affordable credit.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">Business leaders have also shared with me the need for improved infrastructure to transport goods and a reduction in the number of checkpoints along major trade corridors, which lead to lost time and money.\u00a0 According to regional monitors, a typical agricultural exporter faces more than 40 checkpoints between Accra and the border with Burkina Faso and pays more than $100 in \u201cfacilitation payments.\u201d\u00a0 Addressing both of these issues would be a positive step toward increasing regional trade.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">We must also address corruption.\u00a0 Everyone knows it exists in various forms throughout society, but very few are willing to stand up against it.\u00a0 All of us in the room today have a responsibility to speak out\u2014proactively\u2014against this cancerous tumor.\u00a0 Corruption destroys economies.\u00a0 It stunts business investment and development.\u00a0 In the Gospel of John, we read that \u201clight shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.\u201d\u00a0 All of us in the room today, American and Ghanaian, must be willing to stand up and be the light needed to drive away the shadowy elements that hinder Ghana\u2019s road to peace and prosperity.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">Along with corruption, political stability is a concern for companies currently operating in Ghana and others considering a local presence.\u00a0 Ghana has a positive story to tell in this area.\u00a0 Since 1992, Ghana has held six consecutive peaceful, democratic national elections deemed to have been free and fair\u2014two of which led to the peaceful transfer of power between Ghana\u2019s major political parties.\u00a0 Ghana has a reputation as a model of democracy.\u00a0 I expect this reputation to remain intact as we near this year\u2019s national elections.\u00a0 But much like addressing corruption, ensuring peaceful elections requires each of us to stand up and make it clear that we oppose violence.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">The U.S. Embassy is partnering with the Electoral Commission to implement electoral reforms and improve communication with the media and general public.\u00a0 We are planning to support civil society and Ghana\u2019s National Peace Council in observing the elections and conducting civic education.\u00a0 And we are training journalists on balanced, issues-based reporting.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">Our interest is in seeing a fair, transparent, credible, and peaceful election that reflects the will of the Ghanaian people.\u00a0 The U.S. government does not support a particular candidate.\u00a0 We do not support a party.\u00a0 We will work with the elected government of Ghana, just as we always have.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">That ongoing engagement is a cornerstone of a healthy bilateral relationship.\u00a0 Strong bilateral communication also ensures that we are focused on the right issues and that our resources are targeted and transformative.\u00a0 For the United States, this means that we must be willing to discuss issues that are important to Ghana.\u00a0 And while we are strongly opposed to policies such as forced local content requirements, we are sympathetic to the desire to develop the various sectors contributing to the growth of Ghana\u2019s economy in a way that does not constrain trade.\u00a0 By the same token, we ask that Ghana continue to engage with the United States, at senior and working levels, to have those difficult discussions on issues such as transparency, implementing more business-friendly policies, making Ghana a more attractive destination for foreign direct investment.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\"><strong>Power of Entrepreneurship<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">The United States is committed to Ghana\u2019s economic development.\u00a0 We are willing to partner with the Ghanaian government to tackle tough issues that threaten trade and investment.\u00a0 However, the driving force in making all of this happen is YOU\u2026the Ghanaian entrepreneur and business leader.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">I\u2019m reminded of a quote attributed to Wilbur Wright, one of the famous Wright brothers who invented the first functioning airplane.\u00a0 When asked what advice he would give to a young entrepreneur, he said:\u00a0 <i>\u201c[to] succeed in life, I would say \u2026 pick out a good father and mother.\u201d<\/i><\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">Much like a mother and father provide a stable home and encouragement, we embrace the role of government in building a strong foundation and providing an ecosystem that supports entrepreneurs and business.\u00a0 We know that entrepreneurs can help address many of the most pressing challenges confronting our nations, including creating jobs and opportunity for young people.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">President Obama created the annual Global Entrepreneurship Summit, where we connect the world\u2019s best and brightest entrepreneurs with the partners and the tools they need to create and innovate.\u00a0 This year\u2019s Summit, which just concluded yesterday, had representation from 160 countries, including several entrepreneurs from Ghana.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">As an embassy, we partner with the Stanford SEED Center, the Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology, Webster University, and Ashesi University\u2014organizations that share our same vision of entrepreneurship revolutionizing business models and bolstering economies struggling to compete in today\u2019s globalized society.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">Governments help create the conditions that give innovators the space to take risks and become engines of economic growth and job creation.\u00a0 And beyond that, it\u2019s up to you.\u00a0 If those conditions do not yet exist, it\u2019s up to the private sector and entrepreneurs to push for the necessary policy changes.\u00a0 When those conditions exist, it\u2019s up to the private sector to grab those opportunities and to spread the gospel of entrepreneurship.\u00a0 A thriving private sector is the foundation for a rising middle class; for security and stability; and for broad-based prosperity.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\"><strong>Closing<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">In closing, I admit that doubling bilateral trade, tackling tough and sensitive issues, and inspiring a new generation of Ghanaian entrepreneurs to lead the charge will be challenging.\u00a0 But that should not prevent us from setting an ambitious goal.\u00a0 If our borders are open to the free flow of capital, goods and services, technology, and innovation, then trade will flourish and jobs will result.\u00a0 Today, I challenge all of us, our governments, and leaders across political parties, business, academia, and civil society to work together to realize the full potential of the U.S.-Ghana trading relationship.\u00a0 One possibility might be convening a Track 1.5 event during the first 100 days of the new Ghanaian government to begin a conversation on how we can best accomplish this task.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">As I approach the end of my first six months here as Ambassador, I am truly awed by the kindness of the Ghanaian people, their determination to make their country great, and the depth and strength of the U.S.-Ghana partnership.\u00a0 I am excited to think about the possibilities that are yet to come.\u00a0 I look forward to the day\u2014not too far in the future\u2014when we will witness a Ghana with an economy growing at a faster-than-average rate; a transparent and predictable business environment; and a flourishing U.S. trade relationship that is creating jobs for both Americans and Ghanaians.\u00a0 Let us start to work together towards this objective today.\u00a0 It will benefit us in the present and create a legacy for future generations of Ghanaians and Americans.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">Thank you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Honorable
