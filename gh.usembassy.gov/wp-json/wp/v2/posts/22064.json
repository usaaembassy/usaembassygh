States has now donated 4.2 million doses to Ghana since September<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Accra, Ghana \u2013 <\/strong>More than 1.7 million doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine arrived in Ghana today, bringing the total of U.S. donated vaccines to Ghana to more than 4.2 million doses since September.\u00a0 U.S. Ambassador Stephanie Sullivan was joined by Deputy Minister of Health Mahama Asei Seini, representatives of the Ghana Health Service, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration Kwaku Ampratwum Sarpong, and the UNICEF Country Representative to Ghana Ms. Anne-Claire Dufay, to receive the vaccines at Accra\u2019s Kotoka International Airport.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThese life-saving vaccines, donated on behalf of the American people, will help save Ghanaian lives, as we work together to defeat this virus.\u00a0 These doses are the same safe and effective vaccines used in the United States.\u00a0 There is no better time for Ghanaians to protect their families and communities by getting the jab,\u201d said Ambassador Sullivan.<\/p>\n<p>Delivered through COVAX, the donations are part of the United States\u2019 global efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. \u00a0In September, President Biden committed to donating 1.1 billion doses of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine worldwide.\u00a0 The United States Government has already delivered 252 million doses to over 100 countries, including 71 million doses in Sub-Saharan Africa alone.\u00a0 With President Biden\u2019s commitment, the American people are now donating three vaccine doses for every dose that has been administered in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>The United States has strongly supported Ghana\u2019s COVID-19 response efforts, providing more than $30 million for personal protective equipment and training for medical professionals, medical equipment and testing supplies, vaccine distribution planning and support, economic assistance for impacted communities, three new regional Public Health Emergency Operations Centers in Ghana, as well as educational support for Ghanaian students during the pandemic.<br \/>\nThis whole of government approach has included elements of the Department of State, Department of Defense, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).<\/p>\n<p>###<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Remarks by U.S. Ambassador Stephanie Sullivan <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine Donation<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>November 22, 2021<br \/>\n-As Delivered-<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Good afternoon!<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m so pleased to be here to receive the next shipment of U.S. donated COVID-19 vaccines.\u00a0 Today, Ghana is receiving 1.7 million (1,736,280) doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.<\/p>\n<p>The United States has now donated more than 4.2 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to help save Ghanaian lives and beat this pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>President Biden has committed to donating 1.1 billion vaccine doses worldwide, more than any other country.\u00a0 And we are well on our way: 250 million doses have been delivered so far to more than 100 countries, including 71 million doses here in Sub-Saharan Africa.<\/p>\n<p>Later this week, Americans will celebrate Thanksgiving, a time when we gather to remember what we\u2019re thankful for.\u00a0 After all we\u2019ve been through in the last 20 months, I am so thankful to be sharing these vaccines with our Ghanaian friends \u2013 the same safe and effective doses given to Americans.\u00a0 We can all be thankful today for the cutting-edge science and innovation that is giving us the tools to stop this deadly pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>We don\u2019t do this work alone. \u00a0We work closely with UNICEF, which is the engine behind COVAX, the Ministry of Health, and the Ghana Health Service to transport these vaccines quickly and efficiently and ensure that they are used for the benefit of all Ghanaians.<\/p>\n<p>Now it\u2019s up to Ghanaians to get their jabs.\u00a0 We were all happy to see the news over the weekend that the Ghana Health Service has approved the Pfizer vaccine for children aged 15 and above.\u00a0 Getting the COVID-19 vaccine can be the first step in building back a better world, one which prioritizes public health and economic prosperity, and shares the fruits of scientific innovation.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for your kind attention.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The United States has now donated 4.2 million doses to Ghana since September Accra, Ghana \u2013 More
