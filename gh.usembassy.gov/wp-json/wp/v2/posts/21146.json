Professor Emmanuel Asante, Chairman of the National Peace Council,<\/p>\n<p>His Eminence Sheikh Dr. Osman Nuhu Sharubutu, National Chief Imam,<\/p>\n<p>Fellow members of the Diplomatic Corps,<\/p>\n<p>Members of the media,<\/p>\n<p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<\/p>\n<p>All Protocols Observed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Good evening.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a pleasure to be here with you at the 2020 Ghana Business Awards.\u00a0 I\u2019m particularly humbled to be included given that social-distancing has put attendance at such events at premium, and no doubt there are many more worthy individuals to whom you could have given my place at the table and on the program.\u00a0\u00a0So thank you.<\/p>\n<p>Social-distancing\u2026 Face coverings\u2026 Veronica buckets.\u00a0 All of these items and practices that have become integral parts of our daily lives over the past year boil down to the same basic concept:\u00a0 Mitigation of risk.<\/p>\n<p>And yet, business leaders and entrepreneurs such as those we\u2019re honoring tonight often succeed precisely <em>because<\/em> they take risks.\u00a0 Financial\u2026\u00a0 Reputational\u2026\u00a0 Even occasionally physical as they lose sleep and forget to eat, so fully do they throw themselves into the realization of their dreams.<\/p>\n<p>And that\u2019s in what we now call an \u201cordinary\u201d year.<\/p>\n<p>But 2020, as we all know, has been anything but ordinary.\u00a0 And so tonight, we honor and acknowledge resilience and innovation under unprecedented circumstances \u2013 Individuals and companies who persevered through unplanned business adaptations, weathered significant changes to every market, pivoted to business models not previously considered, and sometimes suffered deep personal sacrifices.<\/p>\n<p>For both the businesses that are still brushing themselves off, and especially for the winners here tonight, we commend your extraordinary work this year.<\/p>\n<p>On the business front as well as the health front, this has been an unquestionably trying time.\u00a0 Your award-worthy efforts show, though, that with diligence and resilience, success is not just possible.\u00a0 It\u2019s proven.<\/p>\n<p>I believe the same is true with the pandemic.\u00a0 The United States has been and remains committed to supporting Ghana\u2019s efforts to combat the coronavirus, and we remain similarly committed to fostering your economic recovery, especially through increased U.S.\/Ghanaian business partnerships.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m proud that so many American companies have contributed to COVID relief efforts, and I\u2019m truly pleased that so many Ghanaian alumni of our exchange and training programs \u2013 especially women \u2013 have been able to put their newfound knowledge and skills to use so that their businesses didn\u2019t just survive but <u>thrived<\/u> in this new global reality.<\/p>\n<p>Last year, Ghana welcomed thousands of Americans to commemorate the Year of Return, and with that came the foundations of new economic linkages.\u00a0 These connections remain strong despite the pandemic and help to set Ghana on the path to growth in many sectors, including apparel, agriculture, real estate, and many more.\u00a0 These connections to the United States mean that growth can come in the form of skilled jobs for Ghana\u2019s youth, expanding Ghana\u2019s role as an economic anchor in West Africa, and export opportunities for Ghana\u2019s bountiful produce to the United States under the African Growth and Opportunity Act.<\/p>\n<p>COVID-19 risk management protocols may have us sitting a little farther apart than we would like, but rest assured that the United States and Ghana are closer than ever, and ready to do business together.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m also excited about home-grown initiatives that show African solutions to African challenges.\u00a0 I had the opportunity a couple of weeks ago to meet with Secretary General Wamkele Mene of the African Continental Free Trade Area.\u00a0 With its seat here in Accra, the AfCFTA Secretariat is poised, as the Secretary General said at its launch in August, to lift 30 million Africans out of poverty and increase intra-Africa trade by 81 percent by 2035.\u00a0 Effective implementation will of course be critical, but over the coming weeks, months, and years, I foresee limitless opportunities for businesses across Africa to take advantage of the FTA framework and build a stronger Africa for the next generation.<\/p>\n<p>Because really, that\u2019s what this is all about \u2013 the future.\u00a0 Entrepreneurs don\u2019t establish businesses and pour their heart and souls into seeing them succeed just because they can. \u00a0Businesses are a means to an end.<\/p>\n<p>They create wealth, not just for the investors and executives, but for their employees and wider communities.\u00a0 They offer jobs for the un- and under-employed, serve as anchors for national economic growth in the best of times, and engines of recovery in times like these.<\/p>\n<p>And so on behalf of the U.S. Government, and particularly those of us here at the Embassy in Accra, I commend and congratulate all of tonight\u2019s 2020 Ghana Business Awards winners \u2013 and in fact all of you in this room and within the sound of my voice \u2013 for what you have already accomplished, as well as for what I know you will accomplish in the future, and <em>for<\/em> the future.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Drafted:
