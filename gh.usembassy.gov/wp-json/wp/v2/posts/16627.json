we are talking about national security and the theft of countries\u2019 resources.\u00a0 The black market for illegal wildlife products is estimated to be worth a staggering 19 <b><i>billion<\/i> <\/b>U.S. dollars per year.\u00a0 This includes plants, animals, and fish.\u00a0 And, sadly, this illicit trade becomes more profitable each year. \u00a0Unsurprisingly, criminal organizations focus on trading whatever earns them the most money\u2014such as drugs, weapons, and other illicit items.\u00a0 <i>Until<\/i> trafficking in wildlife presents a real threat to their freedom and their income, they will continue to harvest these products illegally for their own benefit.\u00a0 These \u201cblack market\u201d profits are increasingly used to fund transnational criminal organizations, which undermines national, regional, and global security. \u00a0They also deprive nations of important economic revenue or potential tourism revenues, destroy the foundation of society, and strip us of the natural beauty that attracts visitors to West Africa.<\/p>\n<p>Goods made from poached animals and illegally-harvested timber are a problem on a <i>global <\/i>scale.\u00a0 These goods make their way across Europe, Asia, and\u2014at a regrettably high rate\u2014the United States. \u00a0However, the United States is implementing a near-total ban on the domestic commercial trade of African elephant ivory, and we urge other countries to join us. \u00a0This trade in ivory and other wildlife and plant products relies on porous borders, corruption, and strong networks of organized crime, and it poses a threat to our collective security.<\/p>\n<p>All of you here today are taking an important step in addressing these problems. \u00a0Your expertise, your dedication, and your ability to help stop this illicit trade at the source and the transport stage helps us control this scourge at the destination. \u00a0Together, we can reduce the impact of this criminal activity. \u00a0I thank you all for your commitment and hope you share the valuable information you learn here with your colleagues back home. \u00a0As Secretary of State John Kerry stated on World Wildlife Day a couple years ago, \u201cToday, our shared natural heritage is threatened, and time is not on our side.\u201d \u00a0It is crucial we take <i>all <\/i>the measures necessary to stop these inexcusable practices and finally put an end to the trafficking of our precious wildlife.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Remarks by Ambassador Robert P.
