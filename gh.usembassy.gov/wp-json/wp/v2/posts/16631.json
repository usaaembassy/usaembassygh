May peace be upon you.<\/p>\n<p>Babs and I are happy to welcome you here this evening in observance of the holy month of Ramadan.\u00a0 Tonight, we honor the traditions of one of the world\u2019s great religions. \u00a0It is a time when more than 1.5 billion Muslims around the world commit themselves to spiritual renewal.\u00a0 It is a time when we are reminded of our duty to our fellow man.<\/p>\n<p>I attended my first Iftar in Senegal more than a decade ago.\u00a0 Since then, I have hosted or participated in dozens in Senegal, Morocco, and Cameroon.<\/p>\n<p>In my short time in Ghana, I have seen that Ghanaians are firmly committed to peaceful expression and free practice of religion. This is a principle upheld by all the faith groups present here this evening.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, the fact that we are able to bring people from different religions together this evening reminds us that the tenets of peace, justice, and caring for one another are central to all of our faith traditions.<\/p>\n<p>Tonight, as we break the fast, we are joined by Muslims in Ghana, in the United States, and around the world. \u00a0However, we must not forget those who are unable to celebrate Ramadan in their homes, or with their families, due to conflict and strife.<\/p>\n<p>This past March, on my first trip to the Ashanti and Northern Regions, I met with Muslim leaders in Kumasi and Tamale.\u00a0 We had productive discussions on promoting development and peaceful elections. \u00a0I want to thank Sheikh Sharubutu for praying for peaceful elections and for calling publicly for a tolerant political climate.<\/p>\n<p>We will be tested, especially in the coming months.\u00a0 We must stand firm when people try to divide us.\u00a0 As leaders, we must repeat at every opportunity that we stand for peace.<\/p>\n<p>I say this with both our countries in mind.\u00a0 We have seen divisive rhetoric on both sides of the Atlantic.\u00a0 I want to assure you that inclusion across lines of faith, gender, and ethnicity remains a central value of the United States.\u00a0 Ghana\u2019s commitment to these same ideals makes it an important example of tolerance in West Africa. \u00a0We are fortunate to live in societies where acceptance and tolerance of diversity are of high importance.\u00a0 This is a standard we must always work to preserve.<\/p>\n<p>I want to thank you all again for coming tonight to share in this evening of fellowship. \u00a0I hope to continue working with all of you in promotion of tolerance and peace. \u00a0May you and your families have a blessed Ramadan.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to turn now to Sheikh<b> <\/b>Sharubutu for his remarks.\u00a0 Sheikh. . .<\/p>\n<p>Thank you, Sheikh Sharubutu, for your insightful words.\u00a0 And thank you, Sheikh Aremeyaw for the interpretation.<\/p>\n<p>Let me close by thanking you all again for coming this evening to join in fellowship with me and my colleagues, with each other, and with the leaders of Ghana\u2019s many faith traditions.\u00a0 Babs and I have endeavored to create a memorable meal that combines different traditions and that we trust will be pleasing to the palate.<\/p>\n<p>Ramadan Kareem.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ambassador\u2019s Residence National Chief Imam, Sheikh Osmanu Nuhu Sharubutu Honorable Ministers of State; Your Excellencies, Members of the Diplomatic Corps; Members of the Clergy; Colleagues from the U.S. Embassy; Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen.
