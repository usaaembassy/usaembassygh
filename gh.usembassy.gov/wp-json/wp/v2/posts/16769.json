margin-bottom: 20px;\" class=\"sharethis-inline-share-buttons\" ><\/div><p>Good morning. \u00a0I am pleased to see so much interest in today\u2019s event and in the services that Crowley Maritime and its local partner IbisTek are providing in Ghana. \u00a0It gives me great pleasure to support Crowley in its expansion into Africa and in its recent affiliation with a great local partner.<\/p>\n<p>As many of you may know, Crowley is one of the oldest and most respected shipping companies in the world. \u00a0The company can trace its history back to the late 19<sup>th<\/sup> century when the founder, Thomas Crowley, purchased an 18-foot rowboat to provide transportation and logistics services to ships anchored in San Francisco Bay. \u00a0Thomas\u2019 initial $80 investment has grown a bit in the last 125 years &#8212; Crowley now has global revenues in excess of $2 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Crowley Maritime\u2019s experience serving the oil industry dates back nearly to the founding of the company.\u00a0 Thomas Crowley designed one of the first barges capable of moving refined petroleum products. \u00a0With a focus on providing quality service and ensuring safe operations no matter where they are operating, Crowley now leads the industry in serving global petroleum companies around the world.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most critical factors for success for an international company lies in its choice of local partners. \u00a0Crowley has selected a solid partner here in Ghana. \u00a0IbisTek has been operating since 2005, providing turnkey solutions in the energy and civil infrastructure sectors. \u00a0The firm has a solid management team and the local knowledge needed to succeed here in West Africa. \u00a0Coupled with Crowley\u2019s deep experience and global strength, IbisTek will be in a position to change the landscape of maritime services here in Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>During my time as a representative of the U.S. government, I have been amazed how local governments, the private sector, and local citizens value the important and meaningful role the United States\u2019 private sector plays in developing the local economy.\u00a0 I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work in many parts of the world and recognize commonalities between many of the markets I\u2019ve worked in, including Ghana. \u00a0I believe that the value placed on American products and services are based on five common features that are associated with our very best companies \u2013 our innovative spirit, our reliance on local talent, our strong business values, our sound environmental practices and our commitment to community.\u00a0 I see all of these features well-represented in this newly established joint venture between Crowley and IbisTek.<\/p>\n<p>The maritime industry in Ghana plays an important role in driving economic development. \u00a0The ports of Tema and Takoradi are a vital link not only for Ghana but for the inland countries of Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali as well. \u00a0Development and full utilization of these critical assets will be an important component of Ghana\u2019s future economic growth.<\/p>\n<p>Ghana\u2019s oil and gas industry is of course also a key driver of economic activity and will grow in importance in the coming years. \u00a0Without competent and highly sophisticated maritime service providers, like IbisTek-Crowley, Ghana will be challenged to fully develop the economic potential of its offshore petroleum resources. \u00a0I anticipate hearing great things about the contributions this great American company will make to Ghana\u2019s development.<\/p>\n<p>I appreciate the Government of Ghana\u2019s focus on building the capacity of local companies to compete in developing this country\u2019s economy. \u00a0The partnership that we are recognizing today between IbisTek and Crowley \u2013 a partnership between a strong global company and a well-established local firm &#8212; is an effective approach to building capacity of Ghanaian companies and increasing their contribution to the country\u2019s development. \u00a0I\u2019m confident that in the coming years the linkage of IbisTek and Crowley will be a model for increasing local content in the sectors driving this economy.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you again for joining me today in celebrating another great U.S. company establishing strong roots in West Africa. \u00a0The United States and Ghana have a great mutually beneficial relationship. \u00a0With our shared values and vision of creating prosperity for everyone, Ghana and the U.S. make a great team. \u00a0I\u2019m pleased that IbisTek Crowley will be contributing to our efforts. \u00a0I look forward to hearing of their great success in the coming years.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning. \u00a0I am pleased to see so much interest in today\u2019s event and in the services that Crowley Maritime and its local partner IbisTek are providing in Ghana. \u00a0It gives me great pleasure to support Crowley in its expansion into Africa and in its recent affiliation with a great local partner.
