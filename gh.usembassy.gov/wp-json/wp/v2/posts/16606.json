Jackson, inaugurated the facility on behalf of the U.S. government. \u00a0The Minister of Food and Agriculture, Alhaji Mohammed Muniru Limuna, and the Northern Regional Director of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, William Boakye-Acheampong, were also in attendance.<\/p>\n<p>GSIU is a unit of the Plant Protection and Regulatory Services Directorate of MOFA and its purpose is to increase the quantity and quality of high yielding seeds available to rural farmers. The GSIU located in Tamale is one of three seed inspection laboratories constructed by USAID in partnership with MOFA. The laboratories will improve agricultural productivity by increasing access to improved seeds.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe labs will help make certified seeds more available, so that even farmers in the most remote areas are able to use seeds that bring more bountiful harvests,\u201d remarked United States Ambassador Robert. P. Jackson. \u201cIt is up to the Ghana Seed Inspection Unit of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture to ensure seeds sold to farmers are true-to-type and high quality. It is important that we all collaborate to ensure Ghana\u2019s seed sector thrives.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The new seed laboratory was constructed through USAID\u2019s Agriculture Technology Transfer project, which is part of Feed the Future. Feed the Future is the U.S. government\u2019s global hunger and food security initiative, which works to reduce poverty and enhance the nutritional status of rural populations, particularly women and children.<\/p>\n<p><i><b>About USAID<\/b><\/i><\/p>\n<p>USAID is the lead U.S. government agency that works to end extreme global poverty and enable resilient, democratic societies to realize their potential.
