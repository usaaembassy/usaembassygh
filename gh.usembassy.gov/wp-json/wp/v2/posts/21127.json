KNUST<\/p>\n<p>Other honorifics TBD<\/p>\n<p>Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Tibor Nagy<\/p>\n<p>All protocols observed.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m delighted to be with you all today for this launch of the University Partnerships Initiative.\u00a0 Greetings from Accra to our colleagues in Washington, DC and to our partners in Kumasi, in Texas, and in Iowa.<\/p>\n<p>University partnerships are a critical element of collaboration among American and Ghanaian higher education institutions.\u00a0 We estimate that hundreds of these types of partnerships already exist in Ghana, forged through decades of binational academic collaboration.\u00a0 These partnerships have flourished through exchange programs such as Fulbright, which sends Ghanaian students, scholars, and professors to the United States and brings American students, scholars, and visiting professors to study and work in Ghanaian universities.<\/p>\n<p>For these reasons, the U.S. Embassy in Accra was well-poised to implement the new University Partnerships Initiative that is the vision of our Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Tibor Nagy, who is with us today and who will speak to us in just a few minutes.<\/p>\n<p>The University Partnerships Initiative, or UPI, in which Ghana is one of four African focus countries, seeks to strengthen existing ties and foster new collaboration between U.S. and African universities.\u00a0 Focus areas include faculty and student exchanges, joint research, building administrative capacity, and creating public-private partnerships.<\/p>\n<p>The UPI\u2019s timing was fortuitous. \u00a0The interruption of in-person learning for Ghanaian students due to COVID-19, and the enormous challenges facing higher education globally, require sustainable e-learning programs that increase access to quality higher education.\u00a0 And as we have seen throughout this crisis, faculty and institutions need support and training.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, the U.S. Embassy in Ghana was able to provide funding under the UPI for exactly this type of training, in partnership with the Texas International Education Consortium (TIEC), to build faculty capacity to deliver quality, online, and flexible learning and build a bridge to the next generation of students who will increasingly be virtual learners.\u00a0 The initiative for this joint project, known as \u201cFlexible Learning:\u00a0 Responding to and Reimagining Education in Ghana,\u201d came from KNUST faculty in March 2020 because of their existing relationship with TIEC.\u00a0 This is a superb example of what U.S. and Ghanaian universities can do, working together.<\/p>\n<p>The second project we\u2019re launching today builds on a longstanding partnership between Iowa State University (ISU) and KNUST that was also ripe for UPI assistance.\u00a0 Since 2013, the ISU student group Engineers Without Borders (EWB) has worked on community-driven projects in Ghana, most recently implementing a solar-powered, mechanized borehole that distributes 6,000 gallons of water a day to a Senior High boarding school with 1,000 students.\u00a0 KNUST recently established an Engineers Without Borders chapter, building on the two universities\u2019 MOU signed in 2017.\u00a0 Their joint project \u2013 Institutional Capacity-Building through Engineers Without Borders Collaboration in the Ullo Traditional Area in the Upper West Region in Ghana\u201d \u2013 further strengthens collaboration between the institutions and engages both ISU and KNUST students through interdisciplinary, bilateral STEM projects that bolster their problem-solving skills via \u201clearning by doing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Now that I\u2019ve talked a bit about both of these inaugural UPI projects, I\u2019m honored to introduce the visionary behind the University Partnerships Initiative, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Tibor Nagy.<\/p>\n<p>Assistant Secretary Nagy, a retired Foreign Service Officer, spent 32 years in government service, including over 20 years in Africa. \u00a0He served as U.S. Ambassador to Ethiopia (1999-2002), U.S. Ambassador to Guinea (1996-1999), and Deputy Chief of Mission in Nigeria (1993-1995), Cameroon (1990-1993), and Togo (1987-1990). \u00a0Previous assignments include Zambia, the Seychelles, Ethiopia, and Washington, DC. \u00a0Following his retirement from the Foreign Service, Ambassador Nagy served as Vice Provost for International Affairs at Texas Tech University from 2003 to 2018, during which time he lectured nationally on Africa, foreign policy, international development, and U.S. diplomacy.<\/p>\n<p>And on a personal note, I\u2019d just like to add that I worked for Assistant Secretary Nagy nearly 30 years ago, in my very first diplomatic posting, when he was our Deputy Chief of Mission in Yaound\u00e9 and I was just out of university myself and serving at our Consulate General in the Cameroonian city of Douala.\u00a0 In addition to being my boss, he was an early model and mentor, and one of the reasons I\u2019ve dedicated much of my career to fostering U.S. relations with Africa.\u00a0 And so it\u2019s a personal pleasure and honor for me to share some screen time with him today.\u00a0\u00a0 Assistant Secretary Nagy.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>ACCRA \u2013The U.S. Embassy in Accra and the <a
