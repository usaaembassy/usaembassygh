The manifesto articulates a set of demands that, if fulfilled, will address the disparate treatment women still too often face in their daily lives. \u00a0Although not all of these demands have been met in the 14 years since the manifesto\u2019s inception, the document continues to serve as a rallying point for the member organizations of the Women\u2019s Manifesto Coalition, a group led by Dr. Mensah-Kutin which is continuing the fight for gender equality in Ghana. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A believer in the importance of ensuring women\u2019s voices are heard at local levels, Dr. Mensah-Kutin was a leading advocate for the passage of the Local Governance Act of 2016, which included many gender-specific provisions. \u00a0Thanks to her vision, in recent years ABANTU has trained 5,000 women to participate in local government and helped realize the aims of the Local Governance Act. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the lead-up to the 2016 elections, Dr. Mensah-Kutin led efforts to ensure women voters were given the tools to make educated choices at the ballot box. \u00a0This included developing a scorecard on political party commitments to gender equality, reviewing the status of progress on the Women\u2019s Manifesto for Ghana, and developing a brochure on Women as Voters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">She has tirelessly advocated for the passage of the Affirmative Action Bill, which seeks to increase the participation of women in government. \u00a0In his State of the Nation address, President Akufo-Addo expressed his support for the bill, and committed to working with Parliament to ensure its passage this year. \u00a0I applaud the President\u2019s initiative to ensure women are fully represented in governance, and urge the Government to continue to prioritize its consideration of the Affirmative Action Bill this year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Seeking to empower the next generation of women leaders in Ghana, Dr. Mensah-Kutin\u2019s organization has created an intergenerational mentoring and role modeling program. \u00a0The program has groups in all ten regions, and has resulted in more than 2,000 young women being trained to serve as mentors in their home communities. She has also worked to raise awareness of the relationship between gender and natural resources, spearheading a national dialogue on gender and cocoa, which helped dispel the myth that cocoa farming is \u201cman\u2019s work.\u201d \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As we say in the United States, she is committed \u2014 not to advancing her own vision, but rather to \u201cpaying forward\u201d lessons learned for other generations to further expand women\u2019s rights at all levels and in all sectors. \u00a0She is a hero, for women and for all Ghanaians, and it is my honor to recognize her today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This morning we also honor Mr. Yaw Ofori Debra.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mr. Debra is a lifelong leader in the fight for the rights of persons with disabilities. \u00a0Refusing to let his own visual impairment hold him back, he has dedicated his life to ensuring that Ghanaians with disabilities have equal opportunities to develop and share their talents, and contribute toward a future of peace and prosperity for Ghana.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As a student leader in the late 1980s, Mr. Debra lobbied the Government of Ghana for payment of reading allowances for visually impaired students in tertiary institutions. \u00a0He went on to become a teacher himself, transforming countless lives. In January 2005, Mr. Debra became the President of the Ghana Federation of Disability Organizations, representing a network of eight organizations. \u00a0He understood that protections for the rights of persons with disabilities could only become stronger with a common movement and platform. He saw that it was urgent \u2014 long past due, in fact \u2014 to begin a national dialogue and take action. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He mobilized disability organizations to effectively advocate for the passage of the Ghana Disability Act and for Ghana\u2019s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. \u00a0He was influential in instituting the National Disability Day, and coordinating media and parliamentary caucuses to endorse disability advocacy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And again I come back to Ghana\u2019s 2016 elections. \u00a0Mr. Debra and his organization challenged outdated notions that persons with disabilities cannot participate in electoral processes. \u00a0He sponsored radio advertisements with songs urging Ghanaians to assist family members to vote if they face accessibility issues, and supported work by the Ghana Blind Union to improve accessibility of polling sites. \u00a0The GFDO deployed more than 200 persons with disabilities as election observers. They verified, through their own survey, that more than 78 percent of polling sites \u201chad accessible paths leading up to the polling site.\u201d \u00a0He played a critical role in ensuring that <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">all<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> citizens could participate in the democratic process and have their votes counted. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In 2017, Mr. Debra facilitated the formation of a disability workers union to advocate for improved working conditions in the private and public sector. \u00a0And following the installation of the new government he successfully pushed for fulfillment of the pledge to recruit more persons with disabilities to manage automated toll booths. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mr. Debra has been a tireless voice for including persons with disabilities in Ghana\u2019s development planning at all levels<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. King taught us that the greatness of a nation is not defined and shaped by its government. \u00a0A nation is defined and shaped by its people. People who aren\u2019t afraid to stand up and say, \u201cI deserve equal access to my democracy. \u00a0I deserve equal access to education. I deserve equal access to opportunity.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In a ceremony held at his residence on March 22, 2018, U.S. Ambassador to Ghana Robert P.
