At the launch, the U.S. Ambassador to Ghana, Robert P. Jackson; Executive Secretary of the National Council on Persons with Disabilities, Kwamena Dadsie Dennis; GFD President, Yaw Ofori Debra and others expressed their commitment to partnering to increase the rights of people with disabilities in Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>The \u201cExpanding Participation for Persons with Disabilities\u201d activity will support and build the capacity of Ghanaian disabled persons\u2019 organizations to effectively advocate for and protect the rights of Ghanaians with disabilities. The activity will work with seven national organizations, 10 regional disability networks and coalitions, and 30 grassroots, district-based organizations. The activity will also develop an assessment tool to measure the disability sensitivity of institutions and their compliance with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and pro-disability laws and policies in Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI could not be prouder to be partnering with such a strong Ghanaian organization,\u201d said Ambassador Jackson at the launch event. \u201cI know that if we all work together, from government to civil society to each and every individual, we can ensure a fair, equitable Ghana where every man and woman has the opportunity to reach his or her potential and contribute to his or her community,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>The activity is part of USAID\/Ghana\u2019s Democracy, Rights, and Governance portfolio. USAID\/Ghana&#8217;s Democracy, Rights and Governance programs support improved local government performance, increased accountability to citizens, and transparent electoral processes. The GFD is a civil society organization which brings together the key organizations of people with disabilities in Ghana, representing more than 3 million people.<\/p>\n<p><b class=\"heading2_h2\">About USAID<\/b><\/p>\n<p>USAID is the lead U.S. government agency that works to end extreme global poverty and enable resilient, democratic societies to realize their potential.
