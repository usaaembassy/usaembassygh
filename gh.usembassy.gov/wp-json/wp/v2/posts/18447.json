Jackson<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Tuesday, January 30, 2017, 9:15 AM<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Good morning. It is an honor to be here today to commission this Ambassador\u2019s Special Self-Help Project in the village of Guo. The United States and Ghana have a close relationship, and we partner together on many significant projects across the country \u2014 things like our Power Compact, which will improve electricity infrastructure, and literacy programs that have provided children\u2019s books to schools in every district.<\/p>\n<p>But the Ambassador\u2019s Special Self-Help Program is unique. It\u2019s an opportunity for the Embassy to support development at the grassroots level. Established in 1964, the Self-Help Program draws on the philosophy that small assistance, to a community that is motivated to help itself,<br \/>\ncan go a long way. Over just the last three decades, the U.S. Embassy in Accra has distributed more than $2.3 million in Special Self-Help grants to support communities and projects just like yours.<\/p>\n<p>Self-Help projects must meet some specific criteria:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>They must be initiated by a local community or NGO;<\/li>\n<li>They must be sustainable; and<\/li>\n<li>They must require no additional support from the U.S. government after the initial funding.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When your community applied for assistance in 2016, your application was one of more than 100 requests for funding that we received. It was a very competitive selection process. Your project was one of seven that were selected for funding. The selection committee was inspired by your project \u2014 by the strong community support and worthwhile goals. Community-based Health Planning and Services compounds are critical to providing access to health care and reducing preventable maternal and child deaths.<\/p>\n<p>This expanded facility \u2014 built by your community \u2014 is a testament to the importance you place on your health and well-being. With care and maintenance, it will serve the residents of Guo for years to come. I know some people may wonder why the U.S. Embassy and the U.S. Ambassador would care about the health of a small community like yours. We see the promise of Ghana. We see the growth. We see Ghana taking on a larger role in the world \u2014 contributing to the global economy and to global security. But none of that can happen without a healthy population.<\/p>\n<p>Healthy children can go to school and grow into healthy, educated adults who can contribute to Ghana\u2019s success \u2014 from Guo to Accra and everywhere in between. When Ghana succeeds, it makes the world a safer, more stable place. We all win. The Community of Guo and Chief Kelle are to be commended for the way you brought together religious, political and business leaders to provide for the needs of your community.<\/p>\n<p>We are pleased to have supported this project with our contribution of $6,600 for building materials. But the real efforts were yours. We are honored to have partnered with you and commend your dedication and hard work to complete this project and promote development in your community.<\/p>\n<p>We look forward to seeing your community grow and prosper in the years to come. Congratulations and thank you..<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The chiefs and people of Guo\u00a0in the Nandom District of the Upper West Region were elated when Ambassador Jackson commissioned\u00a0 an expanded\u00a0Community-Based Health Planning and Services facility, popularly known as CHPS compound.
