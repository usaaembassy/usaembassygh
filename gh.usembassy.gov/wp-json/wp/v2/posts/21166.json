Sullivan officially presented a skills-based Disaster Management Curriculum to Major General Francis Ofori, Commandant of the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Center (KAIPTC).\u00a0 Also present at the occasion were the Deputy Commandant, Air Commodore George Kweku Arko Dadzie, and some members of KAIPTC\u2019s Executive Management Committee.<\/p>\n<p>During her remarks, Ambassador Sullivan noted that the \u201ccollaboration among the U.S. Embassy, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.africom.mil\/\">USAFRICOM,<\/a> the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Center, and the Governments of Ghana, Togo, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Senegal is a testament to the extensive network of productive U.S. partnerships throughout West Africa.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The curriculum was produced by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.africom.mil\/\">United States Africa Command (USAFRICOM)<\/a> in partnership with KAIPTC and consists of twelve disaster management courses (six in English and six in French) that build and support national capacity and professionalization of disaster managers across civilian, military, private and nonprofit sectors to deepen their knowledge and skills in emergency\/disaster responses, actions, and strategies.\u00a0\u00a0 It also includes a train-the-trainer course in English and in French to support KAIPTC in the delivery of the curriculum.\u00a0 The curriculum will be fully owned, managed, and delivered by KAIPTC to directly enhance West African partner nation capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>The curriculum has already generated positive outcomes across the region as a result of the pilot courses delivered to 250 select representatives from Ghana, Liberia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo during the development of the curriculum.\u00a0 Notable outcomes include the enhanced ability to develop training exercises, the creation of disaster management communication plans, and the development of crisis response plans using skills learned during the courses.<\/p>\n<p>The Commandant of KAIPTC Major General Francis Ofori said; \u201cThe addition of the DMP to our training portfolio is a great milestone because it furthers our vision to be the preferred international Center that provides relevant training to make Africa peaceful and secure. We are very grateful to USAFRICOM for their investment and technical guidance\/advice to develop and sustain the program.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>USAFRICOM provided funding of over $3 million to develop the curriculum, including reviews by West African disaster management professionals, a pilot of each course in English and in French and technical assistance to ensure the program\u2019s sustainability.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>KAIPTC\u00a0Disaster Management Curriculum\u00a0Outdooring<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>As Prepared Remarks for U.S. Ambassador to Ghana Stephanie S.

KAIPTC is held in high regard\u00a0on the continent\u00a0and beyond, as a\u00a0shining example of peacekeeping\u00a0academia on the international stage.\u00a0 Today we get to build on that shining example and continue\u00a0to realize the mission and vision of the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Center&#8230; \u00a0\u201cWhere Peace Begins.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Under normal circumstances, that is, if we were not experiencing a global pandemic, I would be accompanied by General Officers from the United States Africa Command, or USAFRICOM, who would have been thrilled to celebrate such a momentous, collaborative achievement in person. Also, under normal circumstances, I wouldn\u2019t be looking out an audience of people wearing masks! But I am glad you are, for we must continue to respect the Covid-19 protocols. After all, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.<\/p>\n<p>But these are not normal circumstances. The COVID-19 pandemic has truly reshaped every aspect of our lives. The way governments at the local, regional, and national levels handle the response to the pandemic is critically important to the health and well-being of citizens across the globe.<\/p>\n<p>This gives a particular importance to the\u00a0work product we\u2019re outdooring today, which will assist governments throughout the region in responding to disasters. \u00a0From earthquakes to pandemics, the Center will now be capable of educating, and building the capacity of, disaster management professionals from all over the region.\u00a0Not only will this new course material further the mission and vision of the Center, it will also contribute to the lasting legacy of the honorable Kofi Annan himself, who was acutely aware of the destabilizing effects of natural and man-made disasters, as well as the need to work together as an international community in responding to those disasters. As he so eloquently noted:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhether our challenge is peacemaking, nation-building, democratization, or responding to natural or man-made disasters, we have seen that even the strongest amongst us cannot succeed alone.\u201d\u00a0 That drive for nations to work together to tackle our most difficult problems is what started this West Africa Disaster Management Program over three years ago, and it\u2019s what will make this program successful for years to come.<\/p>\n<p>So, with that, allow me to share with you a brief history of the program we are outdooring today.\u00a0\u00a0In 2017, the U.S. Department of\u00a0Defense approved funding to enable KAIPTC\u2019s\u00a0goal\u00a0of developing and piloting a set of\u00a0Disaster Management courses\u00a0as a\u00a0follow-on\u00a0to the West Africa Disaster Preparedness\u00a0Initiative (WADPI).\u00a0That initiative emerged from the 2015 West Africa Ebola crisis.<\/p>\n<p>USAFRICOM provided funding of over $3 million to develop the curriculum, including reviews by U.S. and West African disaster management professionals, a pilot of each course in English and in French, and technical assistance to ensure the program\u2019s sustainability.\u00a0\u00a0The aim of this initiative\u00a0was to\u00a0co-create a sustainable, West Africa-focused,\u00a0professional\u00a0program to train\u00a0disaster management\u00a0professionals\u00a0from the sub-region. KAIPTC was the perfect partner for establishing that hub.<\/p>\n<p>Today,\u00a0after more than three years of collaborative efforts, I\u2019m proud to announce that, together, we have\u00a0accomplished\u00a0this aim, and we\u00a0are\u00a0ready to put it to work!<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0collaboration among the U.S. Embassy,\u00a0USAFRICOM,\u00a0the Kofi Annan Center, and the Governments of Ghana, Togo, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Senegal is a testament to the extensive network of productive U.S. partnerships throughout\u00a0West Africa.\u00a0 While not wishing for any disasters, as I noted earlier, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m looking forward to\u00a0seeing\u00a0first-hand\u00a0the dividends this program\u00a0will\u00a0produce for\u00a0disaster management professionals from across the region\u00a0for\u00a0years to come, including developing a common approach that will help cross-border planning and coordination.<\/p>\n<p>Major General Ofori, colleagues, and friends &#8230; \u00a0With that introduction, I\u2019m pleased to outdoor the newest addition to the curriculum at the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Institute<strong>:<\/strong> \u00a0the\u00a0West Africa\u00a0Disaster\u00a0Management Professional Training Course!<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">###<\/p>\n<p><b>About KAIPTC<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Center (KAIPTC) was established to build upon and share Ghana\u2019s internationally acclaimed experience and competence in peace operations with other states in the ECOWAS region and the rest of Africa. The Center delivers training courses in three thematic areas; Peace Support Operations, Conflict Management and Peace and Security Studies and also offers Master\u2019s and PhD programs in same. The KAIPTC has a world-class research department that undertakes research in the thematic areas in Peace and Security. The Center has established a Women, Peace and Security Institute (WPSI) that works to build African capacity to fully implement the Maputo Protocol, and support the implementation of the UNSCR 1325 and its resolutions on women, peace and security in the context of Africa.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Accra,\u00a0GHANA\u2014 On November 9, U.S. Ambassador to Ghana Stephanie S.
