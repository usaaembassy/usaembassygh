The vehicles were distributed to nine metropolitan, municipal, and district assemblies (MMDAs) and three regional departments in the Northern Region of Ghana to improve service delivery to their citizens.<\/p>\n<p>The Tamale Metropolitan, Savelugu, Central Gonja, Saboba, East Mamprusi, Nanumba North, Nanumba South, Tolon, and West Gonja MMDAs and the Northern Region Health Directorate, Northern Region Environmental Health Unit, and the Northern Region Department of Social Welfare each received a vehicle.<\/p>\n<p>USAID\/Ghana Mission Director Andrew Karas handed over the vehicles on behalf of the U.S. government. \u201cThese vehicles will enable local governments to provide more efficient and improved services to even their most vulnerable and remote citizens,\u201d said Mr. Karas at the handover. \u201cI strongly believe that through our partnerships, we can foster healthier, more resilient communities and together build a stronger Ghana.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The handover of the vehicles was made possible by the $60 million USAID Resiliency in Northern Ghana (RING) project. RING, which is part of the U.S. government\u2019s Feed the Future and Global Health Initiatives, works to improve the livelihoods and nutrition of the most at-risk households in the Northern Region, with an emphasis on women of child-bearing age and children under five. RING\u2019s main goals are to achieve a 20 percent decrease in stunting of children under five years old and to double the incomes of targeted vulnerable households in the North. RING partners with the Government of Ghana to achieve these goals, and directly supports the NRCC and 17 MMDAs.<\/p>\n<p class=\"heading2_h2\"><strong>About USAID<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>USAID is the lead U.S. government agency that works to end extreme global poverty and enable resilient, democratic societies to realize their potential.
