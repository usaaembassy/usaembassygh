Valued at $7 million, the newly launched Farmer Support Activity aims to bolster food security by assisting farmers to continue agriculture activities in the lean season in select districts across the Upper East, Upper West, Northeast, and Northern Regions, as well as adjacent areas, for a period of three months.<\/p>\n<p>The USAID Farmer Support Activity will be implemented through a well-designed system of cash transfers and agricultural training for 17,000 vulnerable farmers during the three-month lean season from June to August 2023. Through a multi-sectoral initiative that includes the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, the National Identity Authority and MTN, among others, WFP has already identified, targeted and registered the vulnerable smallholder farmers who will benefit from the project. By partnering with the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, USAID and WFP aim to harness the government\u2019s expertise necessary to empower farmers and strengthen agricultural practices.\u00a0 Through this collaborative approach, the project aims to enhance food security, improve livelihoods, and contribute to the sustainable development of Ghana&#8217;s agricultural sector.<\/p>\n<p>In close partnership with the Government of Ghana, USAID and WFP are committed to working hand in hand to implement this transformative project. Recognizing the importance of collaboration and coordination, this joint effort will ensure the effective delivery of support to the farmers in Ghana.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About USAID<\/strong><br \/>\nThe United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is the lead U.S. Government agency that works to end extreme global poverty and enable resilient, democratic societies to realize their potential.
