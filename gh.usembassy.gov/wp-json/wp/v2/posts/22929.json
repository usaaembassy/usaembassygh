I understand this conference and awards event is now in its sixth year.\u00a0 Congratulations!<\/p>\n<p>I want to start by acknowledging the work of the Media Foundation for West Africa.\u00a0 We, as the United States Government, are proud to be your long-term partner as you fiercely protect press freedom and also support the professional development of journalists across West Africa.<\/p>\n<p>Press freedom and a professional, responsive, and independent media are critical parts of any democracy.\u00a0We need responsible members of the media \u2013 like you \u2013 to play a role in policy debates, to help the public understand policies and \u2013 when needed \u2013 to hold leaders accountable for their decisions.<\/p>\n<p>And this is not some far-fetched idea only relevant in other countries.\u00a0 In 2022, Ghana dropped 30 places in the World Press Freedom Index to number 60.\u00a0 That\u2019s a large drop and a concerning one for a country that is considered a beacon of hope in the region.<\/p>\n<p>But it also proves a point: press freedom is not a one-time achievement.\u00a0 It\u2019s a principle that must be defended every day. \u00a0It\u2019s like a campfire \u2013 you have to tend to it, if you ignore it, it could go out. \u00a0And once a campfire goes out, trust me, it\u2019s hard to start it up again.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why it\u2019s so gratifying to turn on the TV and see Media Foundation for West Africa\u2019s Executive Director advocating for press freedom and protecting journalists.\u00a0 Any day of the week, you can see Sulemana out there demanding accountability and transparency.\u00a0 Ayekoo!<\/p>\n<p>However, t has been well over three years since Ahmed Suale was assassinated.\u00a0 His family and his colleagues are still waiting for justice. \u00a0We support the multiple voices in Ghanaian society calling for accountability and a resolution to this case.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why we support the Media Foundation for West Africa and its advocacy role on press freedom.<\/p>\n<p>This year the United States Government is sponsoring journalist training programs across Ghana.\u00a0 And I know my colleagues at other U.S. Missions in West Africa are doing the same.<\/p>\n<p>We are particularly proud of our new partnership with Dubawa this year.\u00a0 Together with Dubawa we are training 60 rural journalists on fact-checking.\u00a0 The training programs help these journalists, who often do not have access to professional development opportunities, to learn and improve their craft, while fighting mis- (and dis-) information.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier this month, through the U.S. Agency for Global Media and the Voice of America, we trained 15 journalists at GBC on digital journalism and related technologies.<\/p>\n<p>I want to acknowledge a group of talented young people that I had the pleasure of meeting at the Embassy earlier this month.\u00a0 They are the Media Foundation for West Africa\u2019s Next Generation Investigative Journalist Fellows, sponsored by the U.S. Embassy.\u00a0 These 13 young people, including participants from Ghana, Liberia, and Sierra Leone are completing an intensive training program focused on investigative journalism.\u00a0 I know they are here and I want to acknowledge them for their focus on excellence and professional development so early in their careers.<\/p>\n<p>In December, working with the Young Africa Media Center (formerly YALI TV), we\u2019ll offer training for journalists on how best to report on people living with disabilities, as well as how to cover disability access policy issues.\u00a0 Because we think journalism can be a tool for building understanding and finding solutions.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why we thoroughly support this year\u2019s WAMECA theme: \u201cMedia and Women Empowerment in Africa.\u201d\u00a0 Women\u2019s empowerment and gender equality is a major priority for the United States.\u00a0 It is at the heart of much of what we do. \u00a0In fact, the United States released our first-ever National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality last October.<\/p>\n<p>That strategy sets four priorities: improving economic security, preventing and responding to Gender Based Violence, increasing access to health care, and advancing democracy, rights, and full participation. \u00a0These priorities are reflected in the work we do at the Embassy.<\/p>\n<p>We know that female journalists bring needed balance to reporting, as well as a perspective that has sometimes been ignored in traditional media.\u00a0 Women journalists need to be part of the conversation, paid the same as their male counterparts, receive the same professional development opportunities, and the same news assignments.\u00a0 And that\u2019s just the beginning.<\/p>\n<p>Newsrooms must be more welcoming, serve as an example, and help counter narratives that reinforce gender stereotypes.\u00a0 They also need to include female voices in policy discussions. The plain fact is there\u2019s nothing in the world that doesn\u2019t get better with more women involved \u2013 whether we\u2019re talking about business, peace and security, governance, politics, or journalism.\u00a0 Did I mention diplomacy?<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you tonight.\u00a0 Thank you to the Media Foundation for West Africa for hosting this important event and for advocating on behalf of journalists across West Africa. \u00a0We all benefit from your work.\u00a0 And finally, congratulations to all of the nominees.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you and good night.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ambassador Palmer\u2019s Remarks 2022 West Africa Media Excellence Awards October 22, 2022 &nbsp;
