U.S. commercial diplomats from the U.S. Embassy in Ghana were on hand to provide market-specific counseling to attendees.<\/p>\n<p>The delegation is in South Africa from Wednesday to Friday this week for business-to-business meetings and a business forum featuring speakers from U.S. and African companies including McKinsey, Sasol, and Ford Motor Company.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Accra &#8211; Eight U.S. companies visited Ghana September 13-14 to explore business partnership opportunities as part of the largest-ever U.S. government-led trade mission to Africa.
