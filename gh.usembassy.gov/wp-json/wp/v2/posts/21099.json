Learning to compete, and how you conduct yourselves win or lose,\u00a0 is a valuable lesson you will apply throughout your lives.<\/p>\n<p>In closing, the U.S. Embassy will continue to encourage young people to commit to their education, to participate in programs like <em>The Spelling Bee<\/em>, to apply for U.S.-government exchange programs, and to eventually pursue opportunities to study in the United States.\u00a0 No matter what the outcome is for you today during these semi-finals, we want you all to keep reaching and pushing the limits.\u00a0 By being here today, you have already shown that you can go beyond the classroom to set your sights on new goals.<\/p>\n<p>Congratulations as you are all winners to us &#8211; and best of luck spellers!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Remarks by U.S. Embassy Ghana Counselor for Public Affairs Virginia Elliott at The Spelling Bee Semi-Finals Christ the King Auditorium, Accra Saturday September 26, 2020, 3:00-4:30p.m. \u00a0 Good afternoon!
