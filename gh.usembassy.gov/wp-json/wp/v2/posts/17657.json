Jackson at the launch of Ridge Hospital"},"content":{"rendered":"<div style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px;\" class=\"sharethis-inline-share-buttons\" ><\/div><p class=\"p1\">Good morning and greetings to the many honored guests who have joined us.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Since my arrival in Ghana more than a year ago, I\u2019ve been pleased to witness the progress that has been made at this facility \u2014 I feel a bit like a proud parent today.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The opening of the newly renovated Greater Accra Regional Hospital at Ridge marks an important milestone in the history of health care \u2014 not only in Ghana, but in West Africa.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Furthermore, our celebration today is proof that the business relationship between Ghana and the United States continues to strengthen and grow.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Ridge Hospital Complex has served the people of Ghana since 1928.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>It stands out as one of Ghana\u2019s primary health care facilities.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Over 90 years, though, populations grow and change, and our institutions must, as well.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>In a first-of-its-kind collaboration, GE Healthcare, the Ghana Ministry of Health and the U.S. government committed to upgrading and rehabilitating this facility \u2014 more than tripling its capacity, to 620 beds.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>The Export-Import Bank of the United States financed more than $155 million dollars of the cost of the design and construction of the project.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Totaling more than 456,000 square feet, it will be the largest hospital in the country.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I said \u201cgrow and change,\u201d and that also means that we need to think about how our buildings interact with the environment and how they use our precious energy resources.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>In December, Ridge Hospital was awarded LEED Silver certification.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>For those of you who are unfamiliar with LEED certification, it stands for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Worldwide, it\u2019s the most widely used third-party certification for green buildings \u2014 buildings that are sustainable and resource efficient.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Thanks to that December designation, this facility is now the first LEED-certified hospital on the African continent. What a tremendous accomplishment for Ghana and for those involved in the design and construction of this project \u2014 and I specifically want to note the work of Perkins+Will, Bouyges and Americaribe<b> <\/b>here.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Their ability to think creatively and adapt their work to Ghana\u2019s circumstances helped make this project a success.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Two more American companies, GE Healthcare and Symx, worked together to supply equipment for the hospital.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>In fact, the Greater Accra Regional Hospital at Ridge houses the single largest installation of GE Healthcare equipment in Ghana \u2014 that includes things like MRI and CT scanners, ultrasound and x-ray machines, and a radiology information system to assist with the entire patient experience, from scheduling to billing.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>The result is a hospital equipped to provide the full continuum of care across radiology, maternal and infant care, cardiology and surgery.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">GE is a well-known presence in West Africa and has demonstrated over and over again its commitment to the African continent.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>The company has even committed 6 billion dollars to what it calls <i>healthymagination<\/i> \u2014 an initiative that strives to increase access to high-quality medical care to more people, at lower costs.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>GE\u2019s work across Africa is contributing to the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals regarding maternal and under-five mortality.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I am particularly impressed with GE\u2019s focus on building capacity \u2014 incorporating local partners, local management and local know-how.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>The GE team in Ghana believes that good public-private partnerships are the most important drivers of sustainable healthcare systems.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>I could not agree more.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I\u2019ve mentioned a few of the American companies that have provided tremendous support in building this state-of-the-art hospital, and I want to be sure to note a few more: Thornton Tomasetti; Bard, Rao + Athanas Consulting Engineers; American Standard; Sherwin Williams; Terex; Hewlett Packard and CISCO all contributed to this achievement.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As demonstrated today, we can mobilize the resources of both our governments to address healthcare industry constraints.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Over the past year, we have spent much time in dialogue with the Ghanaian government, and with stakeholders, regarding how we can have the greatest strategic impact.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This brings me to a major priority of the U.S.-Ghana partnership:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>eliminating constraints to economic growth and ensuring broad-based, sustainable growth in Ghana.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>The development of this hospital has and will provide economic opportunities to both Ghanaians and Americans.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>I\u2019ve spoken about the successes for the American companies involved, but let\u2019s not overlook the fact that approximately 2,000 Ghanaians were involved in this construction.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>The existing hospital has a total staff of about 654. When it is fully operational, this number will go up to nearly 1,500.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I\u2019m often asked why the United States cares about Ghana\u2019s economic growth, Ghana\u2019s health, and Ghana\u2019s stability.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>It\u2019s very simple.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Ghana\u2019s success benefits Ghana \u2014 <i>and<\/i> the United States.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>We share the goal of a stable, financially thriving Ghana \u2014 a Ghana with a healthy and educated populace that can fully participate in the global economy and global security.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We support the Government of Ghana\u2019s commitment to private sector-led growth.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>We believe it will translate into economic prosperity for Ghanaians and that, in turn, provides opportunities for U.S. citizens and companies.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>It\u2019s not a zero-sum game.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>We can \u2014 and will \u2014 succeed together.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Thank you for your attention today.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>I am so pleased to play a role in bringing world-class health care to Ghana\u2019s citizens.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning and greetings to the many honored guests who have joined us.
