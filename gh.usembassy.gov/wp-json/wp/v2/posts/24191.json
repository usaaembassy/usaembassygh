This support has reduced the infection rates of malaria. For example, malaria prevalence in children under five years of age dropped from 27.5 percent in 2011 to 8.6 percent in 2022.<\/p>\n<p>In January 2024, Ghana launched its National Malaria Elimination Strategic Plan. USAID and PMI fully support Ghana\u2019s plan to achieve near zero malaria deaths by 2030.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is Ghana\u2019s largest development partner.\u00a0 In 2023, USAID provided over $90 million to Ghana\u2019s health sector for malaria, maternal, newborn, and child health, HIV, global health security, and more.<\/p>\n<p>PMI is led by USAID and implemented together with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).<\/p>\n<p><strong>About USAID<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is the lead U.S. Government agency that works to end extreme global poverty and enable resilient, democratic societies to realize their potential.
