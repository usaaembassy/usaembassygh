Today, I am pleased to present the Government of Ghana with the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL)-funded mobile phone forensic extraction equipment,digital forensic tools, and software licenses to strengthen Ghana\u2019s capacity to thwart and combat domestic crime and transnational organized crime.<\/p>\n<p>Ghana\u2019s ability to investigate cyber crime within its borders in an effect way benefits the common security of the United States, Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Togo, and the global community. International law enforcement cooperation is essential to the stability and security of every democracy.<\/p>\n<p>We live in a global society where crimes do not stop at international boundaries, and this is particularly true with cyber crime.\u00a0 What directly affects one country indirectly affects the rest of world. Cyber crime actors include terrorists, malign state actors, organized criminal organizations, and hackers or \u201chacktivists\u201d whose main goals are to: destabilize sovereign governments, dismantle economic infrastructure of corporations, and swindle unsuspecting citizens of their hard-earned money through deception by a few strokes on a computer keyboard or clicks on a cell phone.<\/p>\n<p>We recognize, as Ghana does, the importance of a robust cyber security infrastructure.\u00a0 In 2016, Ghana selected cybercrime and cyber security as one of the Security Governance Initiative (SGI) focus areas.\u00a0 In fact, in the SGI Steering Committee meeting yesterday, our panels highlighted Ghana\u2019s progress in this area, including Ghana\u2019s accession to the Budapest Convention, which fosters international cooperation and information-sharing, and supports capacity-building of member nations.<\/p>\n<p>I also want to applaud the strong law enforcement partnership among the United States and Ghana, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, and Togo in dismantling cybercrime, transnational, and organized crime networks. \u00a0Through law enforcement partnerships, we can help and learn from one another.<\/p>\n<p>The training you have just completed provided you information about the Dark Web, virtual currencies, and online undercover techniques.\u00a0 The tools you learned about and the skills you have gained will assist you in finding dark markets, tracing virtual currencies to identify subjects, and gathering evidence to prosecute criminals exploiting these technologies.<\/p>\n<p>The network you have developed with professional colleagues is also an important feature of this past week. Our international law enforcement cooperation allows us all to fight crime more effectively.\u00a0 For example, our U.S.-Ghana partnership led to the apprehension of two U.S. fugitives in the Northern Region. They are currently pending extradition to the United States to face justice.<\/p>\n<p>Please receive my congratulations \u2013 felicitations \u2013 on completing this training and my best wishes in your professional endeavors to defend your countries and fellow citizens against cyber crimes. As you move forward in your work, know you can count on the continued support of the United States of America.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you. Merci.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement and Federal Bureau of Investigation Cyber Investigations Pilot Project Donation Ceremony Friday, May 10, 2019, 11:00 a.m. \u2013 12:00 p.m. \u00a0 Economic and Organized Crime Office (EOCO) Executive Director, Mr. Frank Adu-Poku, Director-General of the Criminal Investigations Department (CID), Maame Yaa Tiwaa Addo-Danquah, Colleagues visiting from Washington, FBI &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1058,"featured_media":19642,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_gpalab_slo_mission_select":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[4,54,61],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-19643","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-ambassador","category-speeches","category-us-and-gh"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>INL and FBI Cyber Investigations Pilot Project Donation Ceremony - Remarks by Amb.
