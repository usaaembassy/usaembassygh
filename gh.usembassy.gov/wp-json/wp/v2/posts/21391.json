This support is critical to controlling the pandemic, slowing the emergence of new variants, and helping to restart the global economy.<\/p>\n<p>In view of the launch and the example set by the first and second couples of Ghana and other eminent persons by receiving the first vaccinations, U.S. Ambassador to Ghana Stephanie Sullivan reiterates the United States partnership with Ghana and congratulates the government of Ghana for its tireless commitment to reduce transmission and halt the spread of the virus, paving the way to build a stronger and more resilient Ghana. The U.S. Ambassador encourages everyone to \u201cProtect Yourself, Protect Your Family, Get Vaccinated Against Coronavirus,\u201d the theme of the vaccination campaign.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. government will provide additional funding to the COVAX facility through 2022 and will work with other donors to make further pledges and commitments to meet the facility\u2019s critical needs. The U.S government is committed to working with partners and governments to support global COVID-19 vaccination efforts, with a focus on vaccinating vulnerable populations.<\/p>\n<p>For 60 years, the U.S. government, through USAID, has worked with Ghana\u2019s health sector to build capacity and strengthen services that have contributed to improving the health of Ghanaians.\u00a0 To support Ghana\u2019s COVID-19 response, to date, USAID has provided $19 million to address the immediate and medium-term effects of COVID-19 on the health, agriculture, and education sectors, and to support the hard-hit private sector. \u00a0USAID supports the Ministry of Health to train health workers in COVID-19 critical care; disseminate social and behavior change messages to increase knowledge and awareness around COVID-19, including increasing the number of people who receive the COVID-19 vaccine and deliver life-saving supplies and commodities across the country.\u00a0 In addition to USAID\u2019s efforts, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have also provided critical technical assistance to strengthen contact tracing, surveillance, and laboratory activities.\u00a0 The U.S. Department of Defense has\u00a0coordinated donations of personal protective equipment and\u00a0medical supplies to aid frontline health care workers as well as testing supplies to increase Ghana\u2019s testing capacity. \u00a0The U.S. government&#8217;s Power Africa initiative recently supported the electrification of 65 health facilities in the Ashanti region with solar power, enabling the facilities to operate at night, diversify their services, and ensure a vaccine cold chain that extends into rural areas.\u00a0 Additionally, the United States facilitated the Ghana Armed Forces redeployment of one of the two U.S.-donated state-of-the-art peacekeeping field hospitals into a COVID-19 treatment facility.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">###<\/p>\n<p><b><i>About USAID<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p>USAID is the lead U.S. Government agency that works to end extreme global poverty and enable resilient, democratic societies to realize their potential.\u00a0 USAID&#8217;s activities and strategic partnerships support Ghana&#8217;s journey to self-reliance and advances an integrated approach to development.\u00a0 It promotes accountability, sustainable systems, and inclusive development.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Accra, Ghana\u00a0\u2013 The United States congratulates Ghana on the successful start of the COVID-19 vaccine campaign on March 1.\u00a0 This campaign was made possible through the COVAX Advance Market Commitment, a global initiative to support equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines.\u00a0 The United States recently\u00a0 <a title=\"Original URL: http:\/\/r20.rs6.net\/tn.jsp?f=001j086yoKfnZcHaf6M6iAp9YZpol4nRcJS3Sj679EJfPM6R76kpLZ0a-O-0Op4lgV5xKzvW_NgtvHZSVGwTiCXm6EcfFxxMwHWsStABpcLkwMp3VTobYMjqzMYjFdJIxp5syDRy6xMk0AKvR_Jz8jdNLFN2qzfhFRzTN_f9DPgDN1K7-GlNf5F5Z75G1OL9v8fQOv6EHN3Onwg3zRJSUD2WQevSY5aLJLALyinR8UsGvTdK6EjvzcuSBpOUp3_jgokONtfZKpKQhYnfKztDSQm5QEgamCUwf0Q5u5vPrgc6vBHqGB0OZq48cgJcGRHzflHc-SUjewXLUJG7LlHIW0Zg74e0_CMfYrBkk7v8N3lV3HtUC5HJEoHOU8GpNWVl44OpMWhqU72FN8=&amp;c=BG93phCWR-icO4iDmpZ5sFAGF8FqrQGYUUXZlmdaS5d4ebKUaJoFaQ==&amp;ch=tN164-8WNBXkQF3tw_UfO6tpXF2zoDBBJTcWstXeJzWkJbiLQEXfKA==.
