Jackson presented Electoral Commission Chair Charlotte Osei with the U.S. Embassy\u2019s Women of Courage Award on August 22, in honor of her work in managing the administration of a transparent and credible election in 2016, as well as her efforts to boost inclusion and civic engagement. \u00a0Ambassador Jackson and Ms. Osei were joined at the ceremony by representatives from the Electoral Commission, the National Commission on Civic Education, the U.S. government, members of the diplomatic community, civil society, and selected Ghanaian leaders. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At the ceremony, Ambassador Jackson praised Ms. Osei for her commitment to a democratic Ghana. \u00a0\u201cThroughout her life, Charlotte Osei has made a name for herself as a trailblazing woman and defender of democracy,\u201d he said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Ambassador recognized her for capably managing the administration of Ghana\u2019s 2016 election despite challenges. \u00a0\u201cOverseeing the logistics of this election was a daunting task and the stakes could not have been higher,\u201d he said. \u00a0\u201cBefore, during, and after the 2016 election, she faced a tremendous amount of scrutiny, under which many would have buckled. \u00a0And not all of the criticism was constructive or about the political process \u2014 she faced a number of personal, base, and inappropriate attacks. \u00a0But regardless, she persisted, using her conscience, her expertise in Ghanaian law, and her determination to uphold a democratic and fair process as her guide.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ambassador Jackson also commended Ms. Osei for lifting up Ghana\u2019s most vulnerable communities. \u00a0\u201cThroughout her career, she has prioritized the active participation of vulnerable citizens. \u00a0Under her leadership, both the National Commission on Civic Education and the Electoral Commission trained hundreds of women\u2019s groups to get out the vote, and expanded efforts to address the needs of persons with disabilities.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While presenting this award to Charlotte Osei, he also acknowledged the many Ghanaian women who have taken a stand for strengthening democracy. \u00a0He said that they too are heroes because they exemplify the highest commitment to advance the spirit of democracy for all Ghanaians, especially women and girls, whose efforts are necessary to succeed in this critical journey.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The U.S. government works with the Ghanaian government, institutions, civil society, and communities to strengthen local governments, increase government accountability, empower vulnerable populations, and support free and fair elections. \u00a0During Ghana\u2019s 2016 elections, USAID partnered with the Electoral Commission to increase its transparency and communication with voters, train polling agents, and ensure polling stations were accessible to voters with disabilities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>See Ambassador Jackson\u2019s remarks <a href=\"https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/presentation-woman-courage-award-electoral-commission-chair-charlotte-osei-remarks-ambassador-robert-p-jackson\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Accra, GHANA\u2014U.S. Ambassador Robert P.
