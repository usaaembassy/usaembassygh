Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you so much, Boris, for the kind invitation.\u00a0 I\u2019m so happy to be able to join you today.<\/p>\n<p>Late December in the United States is generally a slow time of year\u2026 but not in Ghana!\u00a0 This is December in Ghana, when the country hits its tourism peak, and the days are filled with festivals, concerts, and parties.\u00a0 A welcome addition this year is the Full Circle Africa Economic Conference.<\/p>\n<p>This event, I think, has been years in the making.\u00a0 From the visionary Year of the Return in 2019 to Beyond the Return, Ghana has led the way in engaging the African diaspora for tourism, cultural exchange, rekindled family and ancestral connections, and, more recently, business ties.<\/p>\n<p>The United States and Ghana share a long history.\u00a0 That history had its painful roots in the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. \u00a0It\u2019s also a history of shared inspiration: many of the leaders of the civil rights movement in the United States found inspiration in Ghana, the first country in Sub-Saharan Africa to gain its independence. \u00a0The United States was among the first countries to recognize Ghana\u2019s independence in 1957.\u00a0 And today, many business leaders and entrepreneurs in Ghana find their inspiration in the U.S. business community.<\/p>\n<p>The African diaspora in the United States \u2013 which is represented strongly here today \u2013 is a force for change, for innovation, and for prosperity. \u00a0When President Biden hosted the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington, just about a year ago, leveraging the strength, depth, and potential of the African diaspora was a major theme.<\/p>\n<p>Since the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, we have supported and helped close 547 trade and investment deals between the United States and African countries worth $14.2 billion. \u00a0Supporting the digital economy here in Ghana, the U.S. Development Finance Corp helped launch Africa Data Centres\u2019 (ADC\u2019s) newest data center in Accra and the groundbreaking of a new data center in Kenya, financed under DFC\u2019s $300 million loan facility with ADC.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit was not just about trade deals, it was also about fully engaging with the continent on global issues, like climate, health, governance, and food security.\u00a0 With U.S. support, the African Union became a permanent member of the G20 in September. \u00a0In the last year, 17 Cabinet and leaders of U.S. Government Departments and Agencies have visited 26 countries in Africa, focusing on expanding substantive and meaningful partnerships with African countries, institutions, and peoples across the continent. \u00a0That includes Vice President Harris\u2019s historic visit to Ghana earlier this year.<\/p>\n<p>As a follow up to the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, President Biden recently named \u2013 and Vice President Harris swore in \u2013 the President\u2019s Advisory Council on African Diaspora Engagement in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>The head of Brookings\u2019 Africa Growth Initiative Dr. Landry Sign\u00e9 calls the Africa diaspora a \u201cmegatrend\u201d that will positively impact Africa and, I think, Ghana, in particular.<\/p>\n<p>We are doing everything we can here in Ghana to support this \u201cmegatrend.\u201d\u00a0 In August, we teamed with AmCham Ghana to host the first-ever U.S.-Ghana Business Expo, which attracted 800 American and Ghanaian business leaders.\u00a0 The Expo included a Global Diversity trade mission of historically underserved and communities less traditionally involved in international trade, as well as Black Chambers from across the United States.<\/p>\n<p>Last year, two-way trade in goods between the United States and Ghana reached an all-time record of $3.7 billion, including $2.7 billion in Ghanaian exports to the United States. \u00a0With AGOA (the African Growth and Opportunities Act), Ghana and other eligible countries can export more than 6,500 products to the United States duty-free.<\/p>\n<p>Ghana\u2019s tourism industry generated $2.4 billion in 2022.\u00a0 Americans, like many of you, made up the largest number of international visitors to Ghana, totaling about 100,000 visits last year.<\/p>\n<p>As Ghana digitizes its economy, it is attracting interest from companies like Google AI and fintech innovators. \u00a0On climate-related technology, Ghana is also leading the way in West Africa, creating an enabling environment for electrical vehicles, charging stations, and supporting technologies.<\/p>\n<p>As this gathering today shows, Ghana has the African diaspora community\u2019s attention.\u00a0 Now is the time to drive mutually beneficial business partnerships that will bring our economies and our people closer together.<\/p>\n<p>I look forward to hearing from some of the brightest minds in Ghana and the United States today and we look forward to finding opportunities to support you in the future.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.\u00a0 Medaase.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ambassador Palmer\u2019s Remarks Full Circle Africa Economic Conference December 28, 2023 &#8211;As
