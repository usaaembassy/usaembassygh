Jackson<br \/>\nGhana Police Service Training Academy<br \/>\nMay 29, 2018 | 11:00 a.m.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for this opportunity to highlight Ghana\u2019s commitment to civilian and military peacekeeping, and the United States\u2019 strong support for that commitment. We are here today to celebrate the handover of new U.S. training equipment packages to the Ghana Police Service, including the four vehicles you see here, and other equipment. We have also arranged to provide expert instruction on how to maintain the equipment and make full use of it in upcoming Formed Police Unit training cycles. We want to ensure that this donation will continue to be used well into the future. The U.S. government values this partnership with Ghana, and looks forward to continuing it. Together, we can strengthen the capabilities of the Ghana Police Service so the GPS can plan, manage, deploy, and sustain its police peacekeepers in formed units in the coming years.<\/p>\n<p>Since 2014, the United States and Ghana have worked side by side to enhance the capacity of the GPS to deploy well-led, well-qualified, and well-trained police to UN peacekeeping missions. Together, we have trained more than 900 FPU personnel for deployment to South Sudan. We<br \/>\nare now working to expand that partnership with the U.S. State Department\u2019s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement, and to assist the GPS in building its capacity to sustain units during their missions. The importance of peacekeeping cannot be overstated. All of us are here because we are of like mind in terms of preserving and protecting peace and security. It is important to acknowledge that the challenges faced by today\u2019s peacekeepers are growing and changing across all of the missions.<\/p>\n<p>The past several years have seen a marked increase in fatal attacks on peacekeepers. We pay tribute to the sacrifice and bravery of those who have given their lives for the sake of peace, and recognize those on the ground who are bravely executing the mandates of the UN Security<br \/>\nCouncil. Meeting these challenges requires troops and police to perform their peacekeeping duties at the highest levels of operational effectiveness. Given the need to respond rapidly to crises, police peacekeepers are frequently called on to assist in maintaining public order, protecting civilians, safe guarding UN facilities and personnel, and bolstering local law enforcement operations. It is critical that police selected for these missions are fully trained and qualified for timely deployment to perform their mandated duties. We also know that visible support from trained and dedicated women leaders, uniformed personnel, and staff makes peacekeeping more effective. The United States strongly supports increasing the meaningful participation of women as peacekeepers and as mission leadership in UN peace operations.<\/p>\n<p>The United States also strongly supports UN Secretary-General Guterres\u2019 call for action to root out sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) within the UN System. While most peacekeepers serve with honor, the predatory behavior of a few against vulnerable people discredits those who are<br \/>\nserving with distinction in international missions around the world. It undermines the trust that is essential to their success. We recognize the actions that the Ghana Police Service has already taken to investigate and address recent allegations against members of a Ghanaian Formed Police<br \/>\nUnit in South Sudan.<\/p>\n<p>We hope that, in accordance with the rule of law, the UN and Ghana will complete a thorough investigation and hold perpetrators to account. As we anticipate the next deployment of peacekeepers from Ghana, and future iterations of training for deployments still being planned, we believe that you will continue to be an example for all contributing countries \u2026 that you will model the integrity worthy of Ghana, the United Nations, and the title of \u201cpeacekeepers.\u201d It is our hope that these vehicles, and the technical expertise that the United States is providing, will help us work together to train to the highest standard and deploy in support of the furtherance of peace.<br \/>\nThank you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ambassador Robert P.
