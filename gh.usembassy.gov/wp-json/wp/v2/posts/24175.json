Funded by the FIRST Program, this certification program will help to establish Ghana as part of a safe and secure SMR supply chain in the region.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In conjunction with these significant developments, the Government of Ghana represented by Nuclear Power Ghana is working on a cooperation agreement with the project developer Regnum Technology Group LLC to develop an industrial enclave utilizing NuScale SMR nuclear power plant as its main source of energy.\u00a0 The U.S. government strongly supports the deployment of NuScale\u2019s technology through Regnum Technology Group as a project developer in Ghana and looks forward to seeing the conclusion of this agreement.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is also currently in negotiations with Ghana for a peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement (or 123 agreement) and looks forward to concluding negotiations to enable closer cooperation in this important field.<\/p>\n<p>Today\u2019s announcements build on the U.S., Japan, and Ghana commitment announced at the 2022 International Atomic Energy Agency Nuclear Power Ministerial to work together to support Ghana\u2019s intent to be the first operator of SMRs in Africa and build jobs through workforce development to support future SMR supply chain needs. \u00a0The United States is committed to enabling the use of innovative clean energy technologies to enhance global access to zero emission, reliable 24\/7 power and to support sustainability, energy security, and climate goals.<\/p>\n<p>###<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Accra, Ghana \u2013 U.S. Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for International Security and Nonproliferation Ann Ganzer announced new civil nuclear cooperation to further support Ghana\u2019s safe and secure use of nuclear power, including establishing Ghana as a small modular reactor (SMR) regional hub.\u00a0 The announcements were made at the Africa Nuclear Business Platform meeting &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1058,"featured_media":24177,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_gpalab_slo_mission_select":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[37,44],"tags":[10014],"class_list":["post-24175","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-news","category-press-releases","tag-nuclear-energy"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) -
