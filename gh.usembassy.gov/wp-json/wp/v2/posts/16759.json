The U.S. Government is committed to supporting Ghana as you improve financial sector infrastructure and access to finance. We look forward to working with you towards a goal of Overcoming Obstacles to Unlocking Agricultural Investments in Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Honorable Fifi Kwetey, Minister of Food and Agriculture, distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great delight for me to be speaking today at the second annual Ghana Agribusiness Investment Summit.
