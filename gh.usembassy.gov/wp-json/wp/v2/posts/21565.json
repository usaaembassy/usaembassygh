When one person claims to know what\u2019s going on, see if you can get confirmation. Seek a different perspective.\u00a0\u00a0 Well-rounded stories that allow the public to hear all sides serve everyone better.\u00a0 Leave the one-sided reports and opinion pieces to the columnists and editorial page. Do follow-up reports to update the public on subsequent developments that might not be as headline grabbing as a breaking news story.\u00a0 And speaking of headlines, for a media outlet\u2019s credibility, abeg, use headlines that reflect the story and avoid clickbait!<\/p>\n<p>And while the emphasis on responsible journalism is important, the onus cannot be on journalists and their media houses alone to stay in line, to say no to konkonsa, to refuse to amplify hate speech, and to report responsibly.\u00a0 The state must play an active role in protecting media freedoms.<\/p>\n<p>We are concerned about instances of harassment and intimidation of the media. The murder of journalist Ahmed Hussein-Suale remains unsolved for more than two years.<\/p>\n<p>Crimes against journalists need to be prosecuted as a deterrent.\u00a0 Allegations of intimidation against journalists by political actors and law enforcement persist.\u00a0 And broadcast station suspensions and closures need to be based on objective, transparent criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Passing the Broadcasting Bill will be a good start to providing clear guardrails for the media and regulatory bodies like the National Media Commission and the National Communications Authority, while keeping sacrosanct the press freedoms enshrined in Ghana\u2019s constitution.\u00a0 The transition to digital terrestrial television also presents an opportunity for the Government of Ghana to consult with both the media and civil society to ensure fair access to Ghana\u2019s airwaves.<\/p>\n<p>The world looks to Ghana as the shining beacon of democracy in the region, rooted in the ideals of freedom of expression and speech.\u00a0 On today\u2019s observance of World Press Freedom Day, we reaffirm our commitment to walk hand-in-hand with Ghana to uphold a free, responsible, and protected media, as an essential part of a thriving democracy.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>World Press Freedom Day Event Theme: \u201c30 Years after the Windhoek Declaration: Information as Public Good\u201d As Delivered Remarks by U.S. Ambassador to Ghana Stephanie S.
