But like Oliver Twist, We all want more!<\/p>\n<p>Thank you as well to Dickson and Molly for the candid assessment of our progress toward the goals outlined in the Joint Country Action Plan.\u00a0 We must understand where we are before we can determine where to go.\u00a0 While we may seem a bit behind schedule in the implementation of the JCAP, the focus areas and cross-cutting themes are broad and enduring, making those open projects most worthy of pursuit.\u00a0 And to cite and oft-quoted African proverb: \u201cIf you want to go fast, go alone; If you want to go far, go together.\u201d \u00a0It is truly a team effort!<\/p>\n<p>I took what the Honorable Minister of National Security said about Cabinet approval for the strategies as being more imminent than August 2021 or the end of the year.\u00a0 Yes, that\u2019s right, you said \u201cby\u201d August 2021.<\/p>\n<p>As we move ahead, I encourage everyone to be on the lookout for complementary projects that directly and indirectly contribute to the JCAP\u2019s aims and welcome them into the SGI dialogue and actions!\u00a0 I hope our growing network can leverage the many lessons learned over the past five years and converge our efforts toward Ghana\u2019s enhanced maritime security, more effective border management, a secure cyber ecosystem (which is less physically \u201cvisible\u201d than the tow domains I have just mentioned), and the fair and accessible delivery of justice.<\/p>\n<p>Before I close, I\u2019d like to acknowledge that this is the final Steering Committee Meeting for Molly, our SGI Coordinator at the U.S. Embassy.\u00a0 Molly and her husband are relocating to Washington, D.C., meaning we\u2019ll lose another key figure in the SGI community.<\/p>\n<p>But, SGI is resilient, and our partnership will not skip a beat, even if the cast of characters changes.\u00a0 In fact, the whole point of SGI is to make its aspirations real and sustainable!<\/p>\n<p>Thank you, Molly, for your tireless work to advance this initiative.<\/p>\n<p>Once again, thank you to my co-chair, General Francis Adu Amanfoh, to the SGI coordinators for bringing us together today, and to our focus area leaders for keeping our momentum going.\u00a0 I am so proud of our bilateral partnership and look forward to our next steps together under the Security Governance Initiative.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As Delivered Closing Remarks by Ambassador Stephanie Sullivan for the Eighth Steering Committee Meeting of the Security Governance Initiative \u00a0May 20, 2021, 10:00 a.m. \u2013 12:00 p.m. West Africa Regional Training Center \u00a0 &nbsp; My dear Co-Chair, National Security Coordinator General Adu Amanfoh, Participants, Thank you all for the informative updates and for the lively &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1058,"featured_media":21609,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_gpalab_slo_mission_select":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[4,54],"tags":[6562,6560],"class_list":["post-21607","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-ambassador","category-speeches","tag-ghana-us-security-collaboration","tag-security-governance-initiative"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) -
