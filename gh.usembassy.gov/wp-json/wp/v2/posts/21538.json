Climate change represents the biggest challenge to the future of humanity, and Ghana, like the United States, is no stranger to these challenges. \u00a0Climate change will affect local vital water resources, energy supplies, crop production and food security.<\/p>\n<p>Agriculture remains the backbone of Ghana\u2019s economy, supplying over 70% of its national food requirements.\u00a0 And since Ghanaian agriculture is predominantly rain-fed, it remains highly vulnerable to climate change.\u00a0 Indeed, Lake Bosomtwe is an excellent example of why addressing climate change is a priority for both the Biden Administration and the world.<\/p>\n<p>This unique ecosystem, seemingly forged by the heavens themselves, is in some ways much like our own planet. \u00a0The actions of one community on the lake shore can affect every other community around the lake.\u00a0 Generations ago, wise leaders of these communities made bold decisions to limit pollutants entering the lake.<\/p>\n<p>We applaud the Government of Ghana\u2019s efforts to mainstream climate change policies in its national development strategies, as well as its commitment to developing ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement.\u00a0 The government\u2019s political will is commendable, but the full support and active engagement of Ghana\u2019s citizens are also important for mitigating the effects of climate change.<\/p>\n<p>On this Earth Day, the Amakomhene and I are here to lead by example by planting indigenous tree species around Lake Bosomtwe in an effort to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and fight deforestation and threats to water bodies. \u00a0Today is also an opportunity for us to demonstrate our collective responsibility for the environment.\u00a0 This year\u2019s Earth Day celebration is particularly significant for the United States.<\/p>\n<p>The United States Government has rejoined the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and re-engaged the global community on climate issues.\u00a0 The Biden Administration has prioritized integrating climate objectives into our larger diplomatic efforts and is challenging both ourselves and other major emitters to increase commitments under the Agreement.\u00a0 \u00a0To quote President Biden: \u201cWe will lead not merely by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The United States Government is committed to joining its partners, traditional leaders, the conservation community, civil society, academia, the media, the youth, students, and others across the globe to draw attention to our shared responsibility for protecting our environment and natural ecosystems.<\/p>\n<p>The theme for this year\u2019s Earth Day celebration \u2013 Restore Our Earth \u2013 calls to mind the American saying: \u2018\u2018We do not inherit the earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children.\u201d\u00a0 We are indeed the stewards of this planet for future generations.<\/p>\n<p>And we must gear our collective efforts now towards conserving and restoring our forests and water bodies, promoting sustainable agriculture and fisheries, stopping illegal logging, mining, and fishing, and combatting wildlife trafficking and marine plastic pollution. \u00a0Our attitude towards our planet will determine its &#8211; and mankind\u2019s &#8211; survival.<\/p>\n<p>Today, I want to reiterate the U.S. government\u2019s pledge to continue providing technical assistance and partnering with our Ghanaian counterparts to tackle the numerous environmental challenges. Planting trees in our communities, schools, backyards, farmlands, and gardens may seem like a small step, but many such actions will have a positive effect on the collective challenge before us.<\/p>\n<p>In conclusion, I\u2019d like to commend the Asantehene, Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, for showing tremendous leadership by embarking on the Asante Kingdom Landscape Restoration Project, and also commend the Amakomhene, Nana Adu Mensah Asare, as Chairman of that effort. \u00a0This is an ambitious project that I am pleased to support, and I now ask you all to in turn do same. \u00a0As we plant a tree on the shores of Lake Bosomtwe, I encourage you to undertake similar environmental restoration projects in your own communities.<\/p>\n<p>Our ancestors planted trees for us to enjoy, and while we may not see the full results of our endeavors let\u2019s do our part so that our mother Earth \u2013 our Asase Yaa \u2013 will be in better shape for the next generation.<\/p>\n<p>So, let\u2019s get to work restoring our Earth!
