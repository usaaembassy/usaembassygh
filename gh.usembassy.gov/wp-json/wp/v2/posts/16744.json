The U.S and Ghana share a long history promoting democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. The partnership between our two countries is strong and enduring because of our shared commitment to democratic values, the rule of law, and economic development. Together, we are translating those shared principles into action.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">Ghana and the U. S. work together in many ways that strengthen our partnership. For instance, our militaries have cooperated in numerous joint training exercises through the U.S. Africa Command and are working to jointly address maritime and other regional security issues. We also broaden and deepen our longstanding friendship by working side-by-side on the Young African Leaders, Power Africa, Feed the Future and Partnership for Growth initiatives.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">The United States also has long enjoyed good relations with Ghana at the nonofficial, people-to-people level. Since Ghana&#8217;s independence, thousands of Ghanaians have been educated in the United States, and vice versa. Close relations are maintained between educational and scientific institutions, and cultural links are strong.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">On this occasion, the Embassy of the United States of America wishes all Ghanaians a joyful, and festive celebration. The United States looks forward to building upon our strong partnership in the years to come.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On behalf of the people of the United States, the Embassy of the United States of America wishes to congratulate the government and people of Ghana on the occasion of its 58th\u00a0independence day.
