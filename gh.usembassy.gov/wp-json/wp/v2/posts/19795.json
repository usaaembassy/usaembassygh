The system will supply potable water to more than 6,000 people in the first year and more than 8,000 in subsequent years. With two borehole water sources and a 12-meter-high, 100,000 liter water storage tank, the water system generates 13,800 liters of water per hour. In line with Sustainable Development Goal 6 to \u201cEnsure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all,\u201d the system flows to 12 public water standpipes throughout Tuna and adjacent communities, and separate water standpipes located at three basic schools. Although the Tuna water system is connected to the national electricity grid system, a solar back-up power source has been installed to address unforeseen power fluctuations. To ensure the water system is sustainable, user fees are collected. The Tuna Water and Sanitation Board (consisting of local authorities, community members, and USAID) will manage the system.<\/p>\n<p>Access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation facilities are fundamental for good health, and preconditions for economic and social development as Ghana progresses on its journey to self-reliance. Poor sanitation is linked to stunting and malnutrition which negatively affect health and socio-economic outcomes in terms of disease and disability, brain development, educational attainment and income potential for individuals and communities.<\/p>\n<p>Through USAID, the American people support sustainable improvement in water and sanitation access and improve hygiene behaviors in 30 districts in nine regions: North-East, Savannah, Volta, Oti, Western, Western-North, Central, Eastern, and Greater Accra. USAID also supports household latrines construction; improves WASH infrastructure for schools and health facilities; social and behavior change communication activities to promote sanitation and hygiene at the community level; cholera prevention campaigns; and advocacy for more equitable water and sanitation health policies.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>About USAID<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>USAID is the lead U.S. Government agency that works to end extreme global poverty and enable resilient, democratic societies to realize their potential.
