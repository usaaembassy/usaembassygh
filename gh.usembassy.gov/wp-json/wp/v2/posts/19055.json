The participating nations share a commitment to strengthening border security, regional cooperation, intelligence sharing, and organizational efficiency to combat cross-border crime, drug smuggling, transnational criminal organizations, and human trafficking, among other threats.<\/p>\n<p>Ghana National Security Coordinator, Joshua Kyeremeh, delivered the keynote address to open the event. \u00a0U.S. Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires, Christopher J. Lamora, also delivered opening remarks, underscoring the United States\u2019 commitment to the collective security of our African partners.<\/p>\n<p>The program was organized under the auspices of the Government of Ghana\u2019s National Border Security Technical Working Group, in partnership with U.S. Customs and Border Protection as part of the U.S.-Ghana Security Governance Initiative (SGI). \u00a0SGI is a partnership between the Government of Ghana and the United States aimed at improving the effectiveness of Ghana\u2019s security sector. The United States also has SGI partnerships with Kenya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, and Tunisia, two of which participated in the Border Security Seminar.<\/p>\n<p>Under SGI, in 2016 Ghana and the United States signed a Joint Country Action Plan (JCAP), which identified three priority areas of the partnership: Maritime Security, Border Security, and Cyber Security.\u00a0 A fourth cross-cutting theme, Administration of Justice, provides holistic coverage on the range of issues that impact these sectors.<\/p>\n<p>Read\u00a0remarks by Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires Christopher J.

S. commitment to our shared vision of strengthening borders to safeguard the security of your peoples and nations.<\/p>\n<p>Cross-border crime, smuggling, transnational criminal organizations, and human trafficking pose threats to our democratic institutions, to our collective security, and to our economic prosperity. \u00a0We cannot succeed in defeating these threats alone, which is why our partnership is so essential.\u00a0 Border security is a regional and global issue that requires robust intelligence-sharing, interagency cooperation, and most importantly, strong multilateral cooperation.<\/p>\n<p>The United States began our Security Governance Initiative partnership with Ghana in 2015. \u00a0Since then, we\u2019ve worked together to strengthen Ghana\u2019s maritime, border, and cyber security efforts. \u00a0We also recognize that a fair, effective, and efficient justice sector is fundamental to achieving sustainable progress in these areas. \u00a0Therefore, SGI also seeks to promote the legal and judicial reforms so vital to ensure the success of our efforts.<\/p>\n<p>Specifically in the area of border security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection has partnered with Ghana\u2019s police, Customs, and Immigration services to form a National Border Security Technical Working Group to implement sound reforms and strengthen these key institutions. \u00a0The Working Group has made significant progress, some highlights of which include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Completing and delivering an assessment of Ghana\u2019s border security to identify priority areas for improvements and cooperation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conducting an audit of the legal framework governing Ghana\u2019s border security agencies. This audit identified gaps in the agencies\u2019 legal authorities, and it recommended legislative action to amend Security Act 526 to explicitly allow for interagency information-sharing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Finally, the Working Group developed and recommended a border security framework to the Ghanaian National Security Council. When implemented, the framework will strengthen collaboration and improve border processes for lawful trade and travel.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>That we have succeeded in making this progress demonstrates the significant political will within the Government of Ghana to meet its border security challenges. \u00a0And, I\u2019m optimistic about the even greater progress we can continue to make together.<\/p>\n<p>But while we have accomplished a lot thus far, much work remains to be done.\u00a0 Most importantly, we must move from understanding what changes need to be made, to making the changes a reality. We must move from recommendations to implementation.\u00a0 Attaining our goals will require not only political will, but investments of time, talents and resources by all stakeholders.<\/p>\n<p>To that end, the United States supports moving forward with the recommendations the Border Security Working Group has made, to include amending Security Act 526, and the border security framework. \u00a0We also strongly support active multi-lateral collaboration and cooperation among Ghana and her regional partners.\u00a0 Today\u2019s seminar marks a truly significant step in that direction.<\/p>\n<p>I close by congratulating each of you for your commitment to promoting the security of your nations.\u00a0 Your efforts are a key part of Africa\u2019s development and transition to attain its fullest economic potential in the 21<sup>st<\/sup> century.\u00a0 We\u2019re proud to join you in this transformative journey to ensure that the citizens of your nations enjoy the blessings of safety, security, peace, and prosperity.\u00a0 And together we will do so.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you very much.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Accra, Ghana \u2013 On Wednesday August 29, representatives from the governments of the United States of America, Ghana, Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Kenya, Nigeria, and Togo participated in a regional border security strategic partners seminar held at the West African Regional Training Center (RTC) in Accra, which is operated by the U.S. Department of State\u2019s &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1058,"featured_media":19053,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_gpalab_slo_mission_select":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[4046,37,44,54],"tags":[6558,6556,6562,6560],"class_list":["post-19055","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-charge-daffaires","category-news","category-press-releases","category-speeches","tag-border-control","tag-ghana-security-seminar","tag-ghana-us-security-collaboration","tag-security-governance-initiative"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) -
