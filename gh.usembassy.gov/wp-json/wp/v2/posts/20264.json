Corruption is a global problem, and people everywhere do what they think they can get away with.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For example, if I thought I could get away without paying my yearly taxes, I might be tempted. But I firmly believe that if I did not pay my taxes, I would get caught, with serious consequences such as losing my job, and maybe even going to jail,so I don\u2019t even have the debate in my head. Bottom line: strong enforcement leads to strong compliance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I\u2019m especially pleased to be joined by representatives of Ghana\u2019s two main political parties, the NPP and NDC, which have each spoken out against corruption over the years.\u00a0 Mr. Asamoah and Mr. Sagbefia, I welcome your thoughts \u2013 and those of all of today\u2019s participants \u2013 on how better deter corruption. As Ghana prepares for parliamentary and presidential elections next year, I encourage you to take advantage of the opportunity for public debate on effective measures against corruption. Corruption is not a victimless crime, but is \u201cstealing directly from the pockets of citizens.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Globally, corruption costs 5% of GDP.\u00a0 Corruption increases the cost of doing business and reduces investment in countries perceived to be relatively more corrupt.\u00a0 Under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, American companies are forbidden from engaging in bribery and corruption under penalty of our laws, which are rigorously enforced. \u00a0 Therefore, American companies look to bring foreign investment that creates jobs and contributes to economic growth to countries where they can operate ethically. Corruption also enables illicit activities: West Africa loses $1.95 billion U.S. dollars each year due to the illicit trade in fisheries and other marine resources. Illegal mining, logging, and wildlife trafficking cost nations and citizens even more.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Yet, how do we define corruption?\u00a0 Without dissipating our energies on semantic exercises, let me cite a few concrete examples of corruption:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">having to provide \u201cfacilitation payments\u201d <\/span>to transport goods across the region;<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">having a student\u2019s grade held back until paying a fee or rendering a sexual favor;\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">directing a public contract toward a well-connected insider;\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">using one\u2019s official position to inflate the cost of a contract to the benefit of a specific few, or even to take an official or business meeting for a fee; and\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">taking unsafe construction shortcuts by bribing officials who enforce building codes. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We all know there is no magic bullet to fight corruption.\u00a0 Every citizen can participate in reducing the corruption which can hinder national development and pose a serious threat to public safety.\u00a0 Progress needs to be made on several fronts simultaneously: ending impunity, reforming public administration and financial management, promoting transparency and access to information, and empowering citizens to demand accountability from the officials who represent and serve them.\u00a0 Ultimately, it\u2019s about ensuring that government at all levels is responsible to its citizens.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To that end, the United States \u2013 through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) \u2013 has supported the Accountable Democratic Institution Systems Strengthening (ADISS) Activity since 2015.\u00a0 Implemented by the Ghana Integrity Initiative (GII) Consortium \u2013 the organizers of today\u2019s forum \u2013 ADISS created a network of local civil society organizations to combat corruption by working with local assemblies to follow up on the recommendations of the Auditor General on district assemblies\u2019 financial statements.\u00a0 \u00a0At the national level, ADISS worked toward the passage of key legislation, including the Right to Information Act and the Public Financial Management Regulations.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The most meaningful and sustainable efforts will be the implementation of Ghanaian solutions to Ghanaian challenges, without fear or favor.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As we discuss in our small groups following this panel, we ask you to not to \u201cadmire the problem\u201d but to deliberate on what\u2019s working well, what can be strengthened, and how, and what additional, actionable measures can be put in place going forward.\u00a0 Finally, we applaud Ghana\u2019s establishment of frameworks to address corruption, both big and small, and pledge our support for such efforts, so that Ghana may complete its journey to self-reliance, reducing corruption at all levels is a key step along that path.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thank you.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Accra, Ghana \u2013 On December 12, 2019, U.S. Ambassador Stephanie Sullivan joined representatives from the New Patriotic Party, the National Democratic Congress, Government of Ghana, civil society, youth leaders, and members of the diplomatic corps from Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, the European Union, and the United Kingdom, in observing the 2019 International Anti-Corruption Day in &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1058,"featured_media":20270,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_gpalab_slo_mission_select":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[4,37,44,54,4007],"tags":[8870],"class_list":["post-20264","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-ambassador","category-news","category-press-releases","category-speeches","category-usaid","tag-anti-corruption"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) -
