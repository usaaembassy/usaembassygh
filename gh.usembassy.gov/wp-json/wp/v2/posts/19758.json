Peace and development are mutually reinforcing, which is why I am so pleased to have Minister of Interior Ambrose Dery representing the Government of Ghana here this evening.<\/p>\n<p>Honorable Minister, the United States commends Ghana\u2019s commitment to providing a stable environment in which to raise and educate her youth.\u00a0 Children\u2019s dreams are without bounds. With the right foundation, they can dream as big and travel as far as their talents will take them.<\/p>\n<p>America is a nation of dreams. \u00a0Our founders dreamt of a nation rooted in liberty, with a government designed to serve the people.\u00a0 In our Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson \u2013 who later became our third President \u2013 wrote that to secure the rights of citizens, \u201cGovernments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\u201d\u00a0 I\u2019m sure he meant Women as well!<\/p>\n<p>At the height of our Civil War, our 16<sup>th<\/sup> President, Abraham Lincoln, referred to this same ideal as government \u201cof the people, by the people, for the people.\u201d From Jefferson to Lincoln to today, the American dream, and indeed the American strength, has been to face and overcome challenges, to strive for a perfect union, and to renew the American spirit.<\/p>\n<p>We proudly draw on the talents of people who have come to our shores from all over the world.\u00a0 Our national motto, E Pluribus Unum, reflects this ideal \u2026 From Many, One.<\/p>\n<p>And it is people from every race, color, and creed; from every ethnic heritage; and the full socioeconomic spectrum who built America.<\/p>\n<p>They are the people who harnessed electricity, developed life-saving medical technologies, and put a man on the Moon. Standing as we are here in Africa, a continent to which at least 50 million of my fellow citizens can trace their ancestry, I want to note that African-Americans have made particularly important, and (far too often) unknown or under-appreciated contributions to this history. Therefore, as we reflect on the U.S. space program, I think about Katherine Johnson, the African-American mathematician whom astronaut John Glenn personally requested to program the orbital path \u00a0of his \u201cFriendship 7\u201d spacecraft.<\/p>\n<p>Glenn asked Johnson to double-check, by hand, the complex equations of NASA\u2019s computers, to ensure there would be no life-threatening mistakes.\u00a0He placed his life, and the success of the mission, in her hands and brilliant intellect. Because of the contributions of Katherine Johnson and countless others, John Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth.<\/p>\n<p>Today, Americans from all walks of life continue to travel. This includes American students, who enroll in Ghanaian universities or participate in exchange programs here, driven by their intellectual curiosity.<\/p>\n<p>It includes Peace Corps Volunteers, who, since 1961 have come to Ghana, Peace Corps\u2019 first country of service. These Volunteers leave their familiar homes and friends to live and work in rural areas. Then they bring the world back home. \u00a0John\u2019s and my Peace Corps experiences forever shaped the people we became.\u00a0 Like the astronauts, Peace Corps Volunteers are on their own voyages of discovery.\u00a0 But even more, they\u2019re developing friendships that will last lifetimes. \u00a0It\u2019s noteworthy that President John F. Kennedy, who founded the Peace Corps, was also the President who first articulated the dream of putting a man on the Moon. Some people at the time thought such a dream was completely unrealistic.\u00a0 But it wasn\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>Nor are the dreams of Ghanaians unrealistic.\u00a0 When we talk about assisting Ghana in her journey to self-reliance, we do not focus on the difficulties, but imagine the possibilities.<\/p>\n<p>The United States enthusiastically supports Ghana\u2019s promotion of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (or STEM) education &#8211; foundational areas for Ghana\u2019s long-term development.<\/p>\n<p>Last month, at Lawrence Technological University in Michigan, nine incredible girls from Methodist Girls\u2019 Senior High School, in the Eastern Region town of Mamfe, triumphed over 24 other teams to win this year\u2019s World Robofest Championship.\u00a0 To Team ACROBOT, we say, Ayekoo!<\/p>\n<p>And elsewhere in America, other Ghanaians are reaching even greater heights. At NASA&#8217;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Ghanaian Engineer Dr. Ashitey Trebi-Ollennu led the team that designed the robotics components for the \u201cInSight\u201d spacecraft now exploring Mars.<\/p>\n<p>In 2011, he founded the nonprofit \u201cGhana Robotics Academy Foundation\u201d (the very organization that fostered Ghana\u2019s Eastern Region robotics champions) in order to inspire Ghanaian youth to study STEM, in part by using the motivational effects of robots to connect theory with practice.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. Embassy sponsored the Foundation\u2019s initial robotics kits, and we are thrilled with the Ghanaian teams\u2019 great success. \u00a0Dr. Trebi-Ollennu studied aviation science after growing up near Accra\u2019s Kotoka airport.\u00a0 He had a dream, and he pursued it.\u00a0 I have no doubt that, in the years ahead, \u00a0Ghana will produce more such engineers and award-winning robotics champions, \u00a0and realize its own \u201cmoonshot\u201d vision.\u00a0 To transform such dreams into actions, \u00a0Ghanaians will need to build on a solid foundation.<\/p>\n<p>I was delighted this past March to visit primary-school children in the Northern Region who were participating in our \u201cPartnership for Learning\u201d project, \u00a0that is improving childhood reading fluency and comprehension in children\u2019s first languages.\u00a0 The American private sector is also helping Ghana lay stones along this same foundational path.\u00a0 For instance, \u201cZipline\u201d recently began using drones to deliver critical medical supplies including blood, vaccines, and antivenin to remote Ghanaian communities.\u00a0 Zipline\u2019s drones may not be flying to the Moon, or to Mars, but they are saving lives here on Earth.<\/p>\n<p>In his 1962 speech laying out his vision for a voyage to the Moon, President Kennedy said: \u201cSurely the opening vistas of space promise high costs and hardships, as well as high reward.\u00a0 &#8230; But this country of the United States was not built by those who waited and rested and wished to look behind them, [but] by those who moved forward.\u201d President Kennedy believed in the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit and a limitless future.\u00a0 And so do we:\u00a0 for America, for Ghana, and for the world.\u00a0 Because we\u2019re all in this together.<\/p>\n<p>When I, in my pyjamas, witnessed Apollo 11 land on the Moon on July 20, 1969, I heard astronaut Neil Armstrong say,\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Not a giant leap for astronauts, or NASA, or even the United States, but for all of humanity. From the lunar surface, Neil Armstrong saw the Earth, floating in a vast space, spotted with endless stars.\u00a0 A fragile blue marble, without distinct national borders, that serves as all of humanity\u2019s only home. \u00a0Therefore, as we celebrate America\u2019s birthday and reflect on one of humanity\u2019s greatest triumphs, I\u2019m just as excited about our partnership with our Ghanaian friends to promote an even brighter future here.\u00a0 Honorable Minister, Ladies and Gentlemen, What do I see? \u00a0I see a Ghana that is ever more prosperous, with stronger education and health care systems for her people, enjoying sustainable economic prosperity, and fully at peace. Indeed, the United States will continue to be by your side as we work together toward Ghana\u2019s own limitless future.<\/p>\n<p>Now, please join me in a toast:<\/p>\n<p>To the good health and long life of His Excellency, President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo. \u00a0May the friendship and partnership between the United States and Ghana continue to grow from strength to strength.\u00a0 And may we never stop reaching for the stars.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ambassador Stephanie S.
