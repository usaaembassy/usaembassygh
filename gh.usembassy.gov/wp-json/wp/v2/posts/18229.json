The number of African students hit a record high at 37,735, marking a 7 percent increase over the prior year.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are currently 3,111 Ghanaian students enrolled at more than 630 tertiary institutions across the United States. Ghana is the third-largest sender of students from Africa, after only Nigeria (11,710 students) and Kenya (3,189 students). Undergraduates make up 38 percent of those at U.S. universities and colleges. Graduate students make up 45 percent, out of which 42 percent are enrolled in doctoral programs. The remainder are in student status while in optional practical training or are enrolled in non-degree programs.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">The five most popular U.S. states for Ghanaian students are Ohio, New York, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Texas. The two most popular institutions are Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, which has 57 Ghanaian graduate students and four undergraduate students, and Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which has 52 undergraduate students from Ghana alone.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Meanwhile, Ghana\u2019s strong universities attract 20,000 students from other African countries.
