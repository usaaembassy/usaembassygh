Through the Akosombo Safe Activity, USAID and UNICEF are providing tents to serve as temporary school structures and essential school supplies such as recreational kits, and \u201cschools-in-a-box,\u201d which contain stationery and material for teaching and learning.<\/p>\n<p>U.S. Ambassador to Ghana Virginia Palmer traveled to Mepe to meet with flood survivors, including teachers, parents, and students. She also met with government officials and the Member of Parliament for the area to discuss how to best support the affected communities and express her solidarity with the Ghanaian people during this humanitarian emergency. \u201cThis support will help restore teaching and learning in communities affected by the floods,\u201d said Ambassador Palmer.<\/p>\n<p>UNICEF Deputy Representative in Ghana, Fiachra McAsey, noted that \u201cthis partnership contributes to UNICEF\u2019s mandate to ensure that every child learns, even in the face of humanitarian emergencies. Through this support, we are able to work together to ensure learning continues for children affected by the Akosombo Dam spillage and other emergency conditions in Ghana.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This support builds upon <a href=\"https:\/\/gh.usembassy.gov\/u-s-provides-100000-in-urgent-assistance-to-flood-victims\/\">USAID\u2019s earlier provision of $100,000 in immediate assistance to flood victims<\/a> in the form of cash transfers and temporary shelters, which were set up by the World Food Program.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is Ghana\u2019s largest development partner.
