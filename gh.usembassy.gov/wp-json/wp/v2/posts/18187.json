Jackson<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>November 14, 2017 | 10 a.m.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Your Excellency President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo,<br \/>\nHonorable Minister of Works and Housing Samuel Atta Akyea,<br \/>\nColleagues,<br \/>\nDistinguished Ladies and Gentlemen,<\/p>\n<p>Good morning.\u00a0 It is a privilege to join His Excellency the President and the Honorable Minister in this groundbreaking ceremony for Appolonia City\u2019s affordable housing development.\u00a0 In August, the U.S. Embassy hosted a signing ceremony between Rendeavour and Ghana Home Loans to launch this great initiative to provide affordable housing for Ghanaians.\u00a0 It\u2019s good to see some of the same faces here again today.<\/p>\n<p>Governments are ultimately judged by their ability to provide services and create opportunities for their citizens \u2014 things like health care, education, a thriving private sector and, our focus today, access to quality, affordable housing.\u00a0 Today, the Government of Ghana sends a clear signal of its commitment to easing the housing crisis.\u00a0 I am pleased that the United States is able to play a role in the solution.<\/p>\n<p>Since 2007, the United States\u2019 Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) has provided $60 million in support to Ghana Home Loans.\u00a0 This funding has helped to make mortgages available to Ghanaian families seeking affordable housing.\u00a0 It\u2019s exciting to see this support extend further through Ghana Home Loans\u2019 partnership with Rendeavour, which matches financing opportunities with affordable housing stock.<\/p>\n<p>This visionary cadre of CEOs \u2014 Dominic Adu of Ghana Home Loans, Stephen Jennings of Rendeavour, and Bright Owusu-Amofah of Appolonia \u2014 and the Honorable Deputy Minister for Works and Housing, Freda Prempeh,, have come together to make Appolonia City\u2019s affordable housing project a reality.<\/p>\n<p>With Appolonia City carrying out the construction and Ghana Home Loans providing the needed financing, the goal is to see 100 new homes for Ghanaian families completed over the next 18 months.<\/p>\n<p>For many Ghanaians, the dream of owning a home has long seemed unattainable.\u00a0 The gap between the price of a new home and personal income keeps widening.\u00a0 According to the Ghana Real Estate Developers Association, only 5 to 8 percent of Ghanaians can afford a house from their own resources.\u00a0 About 60 percent need some form of financial assistance.\u00a0 The remaining 30-some percent will not own or build a house in their lifetime.\u00a0 Home mortgage products from most financial institutions in Ghana are accessible only to middle-income earners, with monthly incomes of 4,000 cedis or more.<\/p>\n<p>Rendeavour and Appolonia have worked to find an affordable solution to the home financing challenge here in Ghana \u2014 a solution that addresses the needs of those consumers who have more limited assets and financial resources.\u00a0 Some experts predict that Ghana\u2019s housing deficit will grow from 1.7 million units to 2.4 million units by 2026.\u00a0 Without a viable mortgage industry, that shortfall will be all but insurmountable.\u00a0 A housing deficit of that magnitude will undermine economic growth.<\/p>\n<p>I applaud President Akufo-Addo and Vice President Bawumia for pledging that the government will do its part \u2014 by supporting the development of the home mortgage sector, and by tackling land titling and property registration issues.\u00a0 I am proud that the United States, through OPIC, is able to partner with the Government of Ghana, Ghana Home Loans, and Rendeavour to address the affordable housing challenge.<\/p>\n<p>I want to congratulate Rendeavor for its dedication in making the Appolonia City development a reality.\u00a0 As Ambassador, one of my priorities is to deepen our commercial engagement in ways that benefit both Ghanaians and Americans.\u00a0 This project does just that.\u00a0 It is an investment in Ghana\u2019s future.\u00a0 It positions this area as a social and economic hub, and brings the potential for significant job creation.<\/p>\n<p>We can all look forward to enjoying the fruits of these efforts \u2014 the schools, clinics, parks and shops that will populate this development.\u00a0 But even more important are the people and the community they will form.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. President, your support for developing affordable housing will enhance the lives of Ghanaians, giving more of them the pride and security that comes from owning their own home.\u00a0 The United States is proud to partner with you, your government, and these fine companies to make their dreams a reality.<\/p>\n<p>This is another example of our partnership improving the lives of the <em>people<\/em> of Ghana and of the United States.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Appolonia City Groundbreaking Ceremony Remarks by Ambassador Robert P.
