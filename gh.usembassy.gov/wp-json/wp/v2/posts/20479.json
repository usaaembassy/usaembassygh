As our late friend Komla Dumor, of BBC and Joy FM fame, put it: \u201cThere is only one standard \u2013 a global standard.\u201d All of us must be mindful that technology offers us unprecedented opportunities to expand media freedoms.<\/p>\n<p>However, information can also be distorted, and fictions presented as facts, by actors with ill intentions, to sow confusion and amplify destructive partisanship.\u00a0 Disinformation campaigns are not a new phenomenon, but continue today on an unprecedented scale, via the internet and social media, which deliver reports around the globe in the blink of an eye, in many cases, with no editorial oversight, particularly over the \u201cclick-bait\u201d headlines.<\/p>\n<p>I have seen countless stories that are, for the most part, accurate, but distorted by a misleading headline. \u00a0As Congolese singer Kofi Olomide put it: Lies take the elevator; the truth takes the stairs, but arrives eventually.<\/p>\n<p>In 2020, the role of the journalist has never been so crucial, to solid, well-sourced facts, along with accurate headlines, as human beings\u2019 shortened attention spans \u2013 and radio and television media roundups &#8211; mean many people never get beyond the headline.\u00a0 Just say no to konkonsa!<\/p>\n<p>A free and responsible press requires a group effort, and when individuals, organizations, and governments come together to preserve this standard, everyone benefits.<\/p>\n<p>This calls to mind the Akan adinkra symbol, <em>TI KORO NKO AGYINA<\/em> \u201cOne head cannot hold council.\u201d The U.S. Embassy jumped at the chance to partner again with GJA this year in a series of media conventions across the country.\u00a0 These conventions will bring journalists and other civil society representatives face-to-face with government officials whose job it is to administer free and fair elections and maintain the integrity of the electoral process.\u00a0 Together, participants will brainstorm about ways the media can set the stage for fact-based, spirited-yet-civil debate as Ghana gears up for the 2020 elections.\u00a0 We are proud to partner with GJA in making this initiative a reality.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout the years, GJA has been engaged and at the table for key policy decisions from the long-awaited passing of the Right to Information Law to the recent Framework for the National Coordinating Mechanism on Safe and Responsible Journalism in Ghana.\u00a0 GJA\u2019s presence is constant, effective, and reassuring, giving voice to journalists\u2019 concerns and needs.<\/p>\n<p>With each year, the U.S. Embassy\u2019s relationship with GJA has grown from strength to strength.\u00a0 We\u2019ve worked with the GJA\u2019s national and regional bodies on several initiatives, and look forward to the four other, inclusive conventions.\u00a0 I would be remiss to close without acknowledging the great contributions of our Public Affairs team and Naomi Mattos, our Information Officer.<\/p>\n<p>I wish you a productive convention here in Accra.
