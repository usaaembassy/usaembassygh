Please note that you cannot simply log on to a website and vote at the last minute. Some jurisdictions allow you to return your completed\u00a0absentee\u00a0ballot\u00a0electronically and others do not.\u00a0Adequate preparation is the key.<\/p>\n<p>Now all U.S. citizens can receive their blank\u00a0absentee\u00a0ballots electronically. Depending on the\u00a0jurisdiction\u00a0in which you are eligible to vote, you may get your\u00a0absentee\u00a0ballot\u00a0by email, fax, or internet download. To start, go to\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.fvap.gov\/\">www.fvap.gov<\/a>\u00a0to complete a new Federal Post Card Application (FPCA), print and sign the form, and then return it to your local election office in the United\u00a0States. Some\u00a0jurisdictions also allow Americans living overseas to submit their absentee\u00a0ballots electronically. We recommend overseas U.S. citizens get in the habit of completing FPCAs each January. You should include your email address on the form so it\u2019s easier for your election officials to reach you if there is a problem. If your jurisdiction delivers absentee\u00a0ballots by fax only, be sure to include your fax number. Most\u00a0jurisdictions now have voter registration verification websites, and many offer a means of tracking the status of your registration and\u00a0absentee\u00a0ballot.<\/p>\n<p>You cannot register to vote or vote at the U.S. Embassy, nor do we\u00a0supply the forms necessary to request an absentee ballot from your last\u00a0place\u00a0f residence.

You may also drop off your ballot at the U.S. Embassy Consular Section entrance on\u00a0Fifth Link Road (between Fourth and Second Circular Roads) in Cantonments, Accra, every Tuesday and Thursday between 8:30 am and 12:30 pm.\u00a0Ballots dropped off at the embassy must be\u00a0sealed in a postage paid return envelope or in an envelope bearing sufficient domestic U.S. postage and addressed to the relevant local election authority.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Which\u00a0Jurisdiction?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fvap.gov\/info\/laws\/voting-residency-guidelines\">What is my legal residence?<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The issue of voting residence is complex. Even in\u00a0jurisdictions where laws clearly define criteria for determining a person\u2019s voting residence, the final determination is generally up to each local election official.\u00a0The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA)\u00a0allows citizens outside the United\u00a0States (not affiliated with the Uniformed Services) to vote in the\u00a0state\u00a0or territory where they last resided immediately prior to departing the United\u00a0States, even if many years have elapsed, and the voter maintains no residence in the\u00a0state\u00a0or territory, and the intent to return to that\u00a0state\u00a0or territory may not be certain. If a citizen is uncertain about his or her current legal voting residence, the citizen should examine his or her connections or ties to the\u00a0state\u00a0or territory in question and consult with legal counsel.<\/p>\n<p>Only 17 states, to date, provide exemption to the physical presence law for UOCAVA citizens overseas. These states allow eligible U.S. citizens who have never resided in the U.S. to register and vote where a parent would be eligible to vote.

If you claim a particular\u00a0state\u00a0or territory\u00a0as your residence and have other ties with that\u00a0state\u00a0or territory\u00a0in addition to voting then you may be liable for\u00a0state\u00a0and local taxation, depending upon that particular\u00a0state\u00a0law.\u00a0 Consult your\u00a0local\u00a0tax officials for further information.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot (FWAB)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Overseas voters may be eligible to use the Federal Write-in Absentee\u00a0Ballot\u00a0(FWAB) to vote for federal offices (President\/Vice President, Senator, and Representative).The FWAB may be used only for general elections and is a backup for voters who expect to be able to use the regular absentee\u00a0ballot\u00a0from their state or territory but who did not receive that\u00a0absentee\u00a0ballot\u00a0in time to vote and return\u00a0it.\u00a0The\u00a0FWAB must be received by the local election official no later than the deadline for receipt of regular absentee\u00a0ballots under state law.<\/p>\n<p>The FWAB is to be used to assist those voters who would be disenfranchised through no fault of their own, and is not designed as a replacement for the regular state ballot.
