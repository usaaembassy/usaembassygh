We will not accept emailed, faxed or paper applications; this will be the ONLY way to apply for a position.<\/p>\n<p>Click the <strong>Create an Account<\/strong> button. The Account Creation screen comes up. You will see red asterisks next to all of the required fields. Fill in the blanks as\u00a0required. Human Resources will only communicate with you by email or phone call, so please make sure this information is correct.<\/p>\n<p>Next you will be asked to create a password. Your password must have at least 12 characters and must include at least one alphanumeric (upper and lower case), one digit, one special character and no spaces. The password will be valid for 60 days. If you try to log in after the 60 days, you will be asked to create a new password. Then you will need to confirm (or retype in) your password.<\/p>\n<p>Next you will be asked some secret or security questions. These are used if you can\u2019t remember your password. Answer each question in a way you will remember. These are 3 mandatory questions with 3 mandatory answers. You must answer each question with a minimum of 5 characters and a maximum of 25 characters or letters. If you make a mistake, a red validation square will come up. It will tell you what you need to fix.<\/p>\n<p>Next you will see an Account Creation Screen: \u00a0It will show your ID number and your email address. Keep this information.<\/p>\n<p>You will now be able to search for Currently Available Vacancies. The screen will appear and list the position type, title, announcement number, series location and close date. If the vacancy is still open, you will be able to click the vacancy number and apply.<\/p>\n<p>You will see the vacancy details come up. You want to read the Vacancy Announcement and click the Apply button. You must answer all of the questions. You will be asked to upload documents to the application. If you choose not to upload the required documents, you may not meet the minimal qualifications and eligibility standards. You also have the option of printing the vacancy and emailing a friend.<\/p>\n<p>The account that you have set up is the same every time that you log into apply for a position at the Embassy.<\/p>\n<p>If you forget your password, click the Forgot Password link. You will be asked to enter the email address associated with your account. You will then need to answer your secret questions. Your responses must be identical to those you used when setting up your account. You will then be asked to create a new password and confirm it. If you forget your email address there is no way to retrieve the account information. You will have to create a new account.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have applied for a position, you will see all of the positions along with their closing date. You will be contacted by email or phone if your application has moved forward to the next step in the recruitment process.
