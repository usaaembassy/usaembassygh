reduce community tensions and stigmatization between and among historically marginalized communities; and reduce instrumentalization of communal identities for political purposes.\u201d\u00a0 Our second objective is to: \u201cimprove government responsiveness, inclusion, and accountability, to at-risk communities through strengthened inclusive, democratic political processes both locally and nationally; a strengthened environment for accountability and transparency; improved service delivery; and improved access to and trust in the justice sector.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. Embassy Accra Public Diplomacy Section (PDS) invites proposals for programs <strong>encouraging fair and inclusive political processes during the Ghana\u2019s 2024 general election <\/strong>through activities that highlight shared values between the United States and Ghana. \u00a0All programs must include a\u00a0<strong>strong <\/strong>American element and\/or connection with American expert(s), organization(s), or institution(s)\u00a0(separate and beyond any involvement with the U.S. Embassy or its American Corners) that will promote <strong>increased understanding of U.S. policy and perspectives<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Examples of Programs include, but are not limited to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Advocacy and public messaging campaigns that improve accountable governance and strengthen democratic institutions;<\/li>\n<li>Campaigns to promote peaceful elections and campaigning and to avoid violent rhetoric<\/li>\n<li>Trainings and professional development opportunities;<\/li>\n<li>Media literacy training;<\/li>\n<li>Countering mis- and disinformation campaigns;<\/li>\n<li>Activities that increase civic participation of historically marginalized communities;<\/li>\n<li>Activities that deescalate the instrumentalization of communal identities for political purposes;<\/li>\n<li>Fact-checking trainings;<\/li>\n<li>Public debate and civic engagement on critical issues.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The following types of\u00a0programs are <strong><u>not<\/u><\/strong> eligible for funding:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Programs relating to partisan political activity;<\/li>\n<li>Charitable, development, or social welfare activities;<\/li>\n<li>Construction programs;<\/li>\n<li>Programs that support specific religious activities;<\/li>\n<li>Fundraising campaigns;<\/li>\n<li>Lobbying for or against specific legislation or programs;<\/li>\n<li>Scientific research;<\/li>\n<li>Programs intended primarily for the growth or institutional development of the organization;
