Additionally we compete for multiple Department of State-owned funding sources such as the Global Peace Operations Initiative, Africa Maritime Security Foreign Military Financing, and Africa Military Education Program. We also work closely with the embassy\u2019s Political section to execute African Contingency Operations Training and Assistance training of Ghanaian forces for peace keeping operations.<\/p>\n<p>The OSC also manages several Department of Defense programs, including the DoD HIV\/AIDS Prevention Program, Counter Narcotics program, Mil to Mil Engagement Program, Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Preparedness Programs, and the Counter Terrorism Fellowship Program.
