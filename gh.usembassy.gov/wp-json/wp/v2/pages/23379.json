We recommend that parents apply for the CRBA as soon as possible after the child\u2019s birth.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Eligibility Requirements<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To qualify, your child must have been born in Ghana and you must travel to Accra for the in-person interview. \u00a0You must apply for and pay the CRBA fee online. \u00a0To be eligible to apply for a CRBA, you MUST answer all the following criteria with YES.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Was the child born in Ghana?<\/li>\n<li>Was at least one parent a U.S. citizen when the child was born?<\/li>\n<li>Are you or (in some situations) your spouse the biological parent of the child?<\/li>\n<li>Were you physically present in the United States for at least five years before the child was born?\u00a0 (If the child was born before June 12,2017 AND the U.S. citizen mother is transmitting citizenship, then one year of continuous presence is required.)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>How to Apply<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All CRBA applications, supporting documents, and payment must be made through eCRBA prior to the in-person interview. \u00a0To apply for a CRBA online, create a <a href=\"https:\/\/travel.state.gov\/content\/travel\/en\/about-us\/mytravelgov.html\">MyTravelGov<\/a> account. \u00a0MyTravelGov is a secured, encrypted portal. \u00a0Once you have created a MyTravelGov account you can access eCRBA and submit your application online.
