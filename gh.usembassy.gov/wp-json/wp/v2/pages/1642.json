It is acceptable as proof of U.S. citizenship for all legal purposes.<\/p>\n<p>If your child has a potential claim to U.S. citizenship, it will be necessary for the U.S. citizen parent(s) to submit an application for a \u201cConsular Report of Birth of an American Citizen Abroad\u201d before a consular officer.\u00a0 If your child is eligible for a Report of Birth, a passport may be obtained at the same time for an additional fee.\u00a0 U.S. citizens may often transmit citizenship to their children born abroad, but the transmission requirements vary depending on when the child was born and the marital status of the U.S. citizen parent.<\/p>\n<p>The application (Form DS-2029) must be submitted by a U.S. citizen parent before the child\u2019s 18th birthday. We encourage parents to document their child\u2019s citizenship as soon as possible after the birth.\u00a0 A passport application for the child may be submitted at the same time.<\/p>\n<h3>The child must be physically present at the appointment<\/h3>\n<p>If you have any questions about documents or the process, please send an email to\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:ACSAccra@state.gov\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\">ACSAccra@state.gov<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>How to schedule a CRBA appointment:<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete a Consular Report of Birth Abroad, Form DS-2029.
