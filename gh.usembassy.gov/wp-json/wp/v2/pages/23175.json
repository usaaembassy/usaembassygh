DRL may not review applications from or make awards to applicants that have not completed all applicable UEI and SAM.gov requirements. A UEI is one of the data elements mandated by Public Law 109-282, the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA), for all Federal awards.<\/p>\n<p>Note: As of April 2022, a DUNS number is no longer required for federal assistance Applications.<\/p>\n<p>The 2 CFR 200 requires that sub-grantees obtain a UEI number. Please note the UEI for sub-grantees is not required at the time of application but will be required before the award is processed and\/or directed to a sub-grantee.<\/p>\n<p>Note: The process of obtaining or renewing a SAM.gov registration may take anywhere from 4-8 weeks. Please begin your registration as early as possible.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Organizations based in the United States or that pay employees within the United States will need an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, and a UEI number prior to registering in SAM.gov.<\/li>\n<li>Organizations based outside of the United States and that do not pay employees within the United States do not need an EIN from the IRS, but do need a UEI number prior to registering in SAM.gov. Please note that as of December 2022, organizations based outside of the United States that do not intend to apply for U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) awards are no longer required to have a NATO CAGE (NCAGE) code to apply for non-DoD foreign assistance funding opportunities. If an applicant organization is mid-registration and wishes to remove an NCAGE code from their sam.gov registration, the applicant should submit a help desk ticket (\u201cincident\u201d) with the Federal Service Desk (FSD) online at <a style=\"font-family: arial;font-size: 14px;background-color: #ffffff\" href=\"http:\/\/www.fsd.gov\/\">www.fsd.gov<\/a> to seek guidance on how to do so.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>All prime organizations must also continue to maintain active SAM.gov registration with current information at all times during which they have an active Federal award or application under consideration by a Federal award agency. SAM.gov requires all entities to renew their registration once a year in order to maintain an active registration status in SAM. It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure it has an active registration in SAM.gov and to maintain that active registration. If an applicant has not fully complied with the requirements at the time of application, the applicant may be deemed technically ineligible to receive an award and use that determination as a basis for making an award to another applicant.<\/p>\n<p>Please refer to 2 CFR 25.200 for additional information.<\/p>\n<p>Note: SAM.gov is not the same as SAMS Domestic.

Please note, guidance on SAM.gov and the guidance on GSA\u2019s website is being updated to reflect the change in NCAGE requirement.\u00a0 Applicants should review the website frequently for the most up-to-date guidance.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Exemptions<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>An exemption from these requirements may be permitted on a case-by-case basis if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>An applicant\u2019s identity must be protected due to potential endangerment of their mission, their organization\u2019s status, their employees, or individuals being served by the applicant.<\/li>\n<li>For an applicant, if the Federal awarding agency makes a determination that there are exigent circumstances that prohibit the applicant from receiving a unique entity identifier and completing SAM registration prior to receiving a Federal award. In these instances, Federal awarding agencies must require the recipient to obtain a unique entity identifier and complete SAM registration within 30 days of the Federal award date.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Organizations requesting exemption from UEI or SAM.gov requirements must email the point of contact listed in the NOFO at least two weeks prior to the deadline in the NOFO providing a justification of their request.
