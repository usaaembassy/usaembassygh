In addition to providing timely and actionable security information, OSAC also aids in the development of new markets with accurate assessments of current and future security environments. Ensuring that critical security information is shared with those who need it, when they need it, OSAC is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to answer constituents\u2019 questions with expert analysis of rapidly evolving security challenges overseas.<\/p>\n<p>Through the use of its web site, www.OSAC.gov, OSAC offers its constituents the latest in safety and security-related information, public announcements, Consular Affairs bulletins, travel advisories, significant anniversary dates, terrorist groups profiles, country crime and safety reports, special topic reports, foreign press reports, and much more.\u00a0 The OSAC information exchange mechanism also includes a staff of international security research specialists that is dedicated solely to serving the U.S. private sector.
