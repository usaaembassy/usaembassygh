While our official bilateral relationship dates back to Ghana\u2019s independence in 1957, our unofficial, personal ties go back even further.<\/p>\n<p>Thousands of Ghanaians have been educated in the United States. Through the Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI) and other exchange programs, thousands more talented Ghanaians have developed their leadership skills and gotten to know America. Meanwhile, Ghana attracts hundreds of American students each year seeking to experience the rich history and culture of West Africa. These types of cross-cultural exchanges have created long-lasting networks across the United States and Africa.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is one of Ghana\u2019s principal trading partners, with trade volume exceeding $1.2 billion. An active American Chamber of Commerce works closely with the Embassy to develop even closer economic ties in the private sector. American investment remains strong, evidenced by the 37 U.S. companies that have made new investments in Ghana in the last five years. Even more exciting is the 79 new investments or trade deals that have been made over the past year, totaling $800 million.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is Ghana\u2019s largest bilateral development partner. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) serves as the lead U.S. government agency working to end extreme global poverty and enable resilient, democratic societies to realize their potential. Through USAID, the American people invest more than $145 million in Ghana each year in agriculture, health, education, energy, and democracy and governance programs. The new Millennium Challenge Compact II, which entered into force in 2016, will invest nearly $500 million to support the transformation of Ghana\u2019s power sector and stimulate private investment. Also in 2016, the United States contributed more than $7 million to help ensure Ghana\u2019s peaceful, transparent and credible elections.<\/p>\n<p>Ghana was the first country in the world to accept Peace Corps Volunteers, and the program remains one of the leaders in programming, training and innovation. Currently, there are approximately 150 volunteers in Ghana. Volunteers work in agriculture, education and health sectors in all 10 Regions of the country.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, the United States and Ghana are close allies in addressing regional and international security issues. The U.S. and Ghanaian militaries have cooperated on numerous joint training exercises designed to increase the effectiveness of U.S. and Ghanaian government entities and security forces in responding to international threats such as trafficking and terrorism. Ghana is one of only 13 African nations selected for the State Partnership Program, which pairs a U.S. state\u2019s National Guard with the armed forces of a partner country in a cooperative, mutually beneficial relationship.<\/p>\n<p>U.S.\u2013Ghana relations remain strong and we continue to look for ways to strengthen the ties between our countries.<\/p>\n<nav>\n<ul id=\"nextPrevPages\">\n<li class=\"next\"><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/nav>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The United States and Ghana have a close and enduring friendship rooted in our mutual commitment to freedom and democratic values.
