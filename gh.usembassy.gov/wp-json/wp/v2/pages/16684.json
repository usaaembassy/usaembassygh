In the public national schools, all students take a Core curriculum consisting of English Language, Integrated Science, Mathematics, and Social Studies.\u00a0 Each student also takes three or four Elective subjects, chosen from one of seven groups: Sciences, \u201cArts\u201d (social sciences and humanities), Vocational (visual arts or home economics), Technical, Business, or Agriculture.\u00a0 The secondary school transcript should contain a letter or percentage grade for each subject, for each of three terms, for the three (four) years of senior secondary school, equivalent to the tenth through twelfth (thirteenth) grades.\u00a0 Students\u2019 Term Reports (report cards) contain rank in class for each subject as well as grades for classwork and end of term exams.\u00a0 The grading system is tough: 80-100% is usually an A, a grade rarely awarded.<\/p>\n<p>At the end of Senior Secondary\/High School (twelfth\/thirteenth grade), all students take the West African Senior Secondary Certificate Examination, or WASSCE, (SSCE through 2005; WASSCE beginning in 2006) in each of their seven or eight subjects.\u00a0 These exams are given nationwide in April-June each year, but the results are not available until the following August.\u00a0 Grading is exceptionally tough: 4% of grades are A\u2019s, and while 80% of grades are passes, only 53% of grades are credit passes of A1-C6. C\u2019s can be quite competitive grades.<\/p>\n<h3>SSCE Grading System<\/h3>\n<table style=\"height: 288px\" width=\"1264\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Credit Grades<\/strong><\/td>\n<td><strong>WASSCE Grading System<\/strong><\/td>\n<td><strong>Points<\/strong><\/td>\n<td><strong>Frequency<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>A<\/td>\n<td>A1<\/td>\n<td>1<\/td>\n<td>4%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>B<\/td>\n<td>B2<\/td>\n<td>2<\/td>\n<td>4%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>C<\/td>\n<td>B3<\/td>\n<td>3<\/td>\n<td>14%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>D<\/td>\n<td>C4, C5, C6<\/td>\n<td>4<\/td>\n<td>32%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\"><strong>Pass Grades: not acceptable for tertiary admission<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>E<\/td>\n<td>D7, E8<\/td>\n<td>Pass-no credit<\/td>\n<td>27%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\"><strong>Failing Grade<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>F<\/td>\n<td>F9<\/td>\n<td>Fail<\/td>\n<td>\u00a018%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The minimum university standard for admission to post-secondary education is a \u2018C-\u2019 average on the SSSCE or WASSCE, with credits (A-D or A1-C6) in all subjects.\u00a0 U.S. universities should not admit Ghanaian students who have not attained at least this level.\u00a0 Students are expected to retake exams in subjects they have failed.\u00a0 Colleges should require a photocopy of the WASSCE Statement of Results bearing an original signature and stamp from the headmaster or headmistress, as well as the transcript.\u00a0 You are strongly encouraged to verify these documents at source, through the West African Examinations Council\u2019s online system at <a href=\"https:\/\/ghana.waecdirect.org\/\">www.ghana.waecdirect.org<\/a>. The student provides you with a PIN number that they purchase for the equivalent of $3 (available at post offices or WAEC regional offices), that is used to retrieve a printable copy of their WAEC results. This is the fastest and most reliable way of verifying a student\u2019s results from Ghana. All results from all WAEC exams dating back to 1993 can be verified through WAECDirect.<\/p>\n<p><strong>University Education<\/strong>:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ghana\u2019s tertiary institutions enroll over 300,000 students in undergraduate, graduate, certificate and diploma programs in a full range of academic and professional fields.\u00a0 The National Accreditation Board (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nab.gov.gh\/\">www.nab.gov.gh<\/a>) lists 140 accredited institutions, both public and private, offering four-year degrees as well as two and three-year diplomas, which are not equivalent to Bachelor\u2019s degrees, but undergraduate transfer credit can be awarded.\u00a0 Twenty-six percent of tertiary students are enrolled in private institutions.<\/p>\n<p>Ghanaian university admission is highly competitive, especially in fields such as medicine, engineering, law, business and pharmacy.\u00a0 The quality of education is considered reasonably high, evidence that human resources are more significant than material resources.\u00a0 In an effort to attract international enrollment, all Ghanaian universities operate on a modular, semester system.\u00a0 The University of Ghana is committed to 10% international population and attracts significant numbers of American students, as well as students from Africa and Europe.\u00a0 The United Nations University operates several programs on campus in fields of health and development.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ghanaians in the United States<\/strong>:\u00a0 2,863 Ghanaians are enrolled in over 600 U.S. institutions in all 50 states.\u00a0 Their influence is significant: each year, newly enrolling Ghanaian students are awarded over $5 million in financial assistance for study in the United States.\u00a0 Ghanaian public secondary school and university graduates regularly attain admission to the most competitive universities in the United States.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Testing:<\/strong> The SAT and ACT are offered on all test dates, in both Accra and Kumasi.\u00a0 The GRE, GMAT and TOEFL are offered at least weekly at computer-based test centers in Accra; IELTS and PTE-A are also available.\u00a0 Although we want students to demonstrate their commitment and competitiveness, we advocate the use of testing only as warranted, and discourage institutions from requiring the TOEFL of students who can adequately demonstrate their English proficiency by other means.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Educational Advising<\/strong>: The EducationUSA Advising Centers in Accra and Kumasi, sponsored by the Public Affairs Section of the United States Embassy, serve over 20,000 students per year in a wide range of programs designed to strengthen students\u2019 applications and their readiness for U.S. higher education.\u00a0 We are eager to work with you to make it possible for more Ghanaian students to enroll in your institution.
